      <description>In this talk, I explore the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga Sutta and share the story of reconnecting with my first meditation teacher after nearly two decades. The focus is on the seeds of kamma that we plant continuously through our actions. What kind of seeds are we planting right now?&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq7LED3zIJo&#xA;The Seeds From Long Ago The Seeds From Long Ago I remember when I first learned how to meditate on my breath some time in 1990, during my university years.</description>

      <description>Here is a post with a video link on how I got permission from my parents. In early 2001, when I was in Myanmar, and traveling for 1.5 years, I called my parents and asked them for permission to ordain as a monk. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get permission at first and then I told them I would never see them again if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get permission.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If I am hurt alive or dead, you will never see me ever again.</description>

      <description>There are three stories of loving-kindness told in the video posted below. The first story is from Kaua&amp;rsquo;i, Hawai&amp;rsquo;i, when a person did not want me on &amp;ldquo;his&amp;rdquo; street. Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed. Another story was also from the island in 2015. There were children on bicycles who were yelling at us to go away on multiple days. Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed. The last story is from 2011 during a trip to India.</description>

      <description>Ven. Nepal Nāthaputta and I have been going for alms together for some time now. He usually comes with me the whole way on Saturdays and on Sundays, he forks right after the 2nd or 3rd house. However, recently, a new monk decided to join our route. Last week, Ven. Nepal Nāthaputta went off on his own on Saturday while the two of us went on my usual route (good for two monks).</description>

      <description>This year, my AmericanMonk.org website was 504 short of 60,000 filtered views (that removes bots and other stuff). The number of users who visited was up to 36,000. Not so bad and better than the year before. The progress over the years is evident in the yearly chart. Simply by writing down things that inspire me, people became interested. Google seems to like my website and recommends my posts on a variety of specialized topics taking a majority of 29,000 search engine referrals from this year alone.</description>

That means, I would recite a chunk of rules in front of a teacher by memory and then work on a separate adjacent succeeding chunk for memory.</description>

      <description>During the Buddhist Rainy season, I was invited to go to Cambodia as part of a group to deliver some relics and see Angkor Wat. While most people don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Cambodia as a Theravāda Buddhist Country, it is actually 97% Buddhist, which ranks them as the most Theravāda Buddhist Country in the world. The trip ended up being more than 1000 times more powerful than we ever expected and it will be a memory for a long time to come.</description>

      <description>The Wootens One of the few places I have been to in Sri Lanka besides Na-Uyana and The International Institute of Theravāda (IIT) is Spring Hill Forest Monastery located in the Hantanna Mountains above Kandy. My two donors from Kaua&amp;rsquo;i, John and Nandini Wooten were visiting Kandy and I decided it would be good to take a break from the IIT scenery and climate with a great inspirational place for the Wootens to visit me.</description>

      <description>Probably the #1 question we get is, &amp;ldquo;Why did you become a monk?&amp;rdquo; That question has many factors and answers. However, a better question is, &amp;ldquo;How did I actually get the nerve to become a monk?&amp;rdquo; I had a lot to give up. I was a computer programmer and really enjoyed my job. It did not feel like work actually and I was also making more than 15 times what someone on minimum wage was making at that time.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Today we will have a short and brief introduction into the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa&amp;rdquo;. We could easily say it is the most frequently chanted stanza of all Buddhist Pāḷi because this is said before any other type of chant. It is also chanted before every proper Theravāda dhamma talk. We will discuss the word by word meaning and the basic grammar. In short, the phrase means &amp;ldquo;Reverence to the Buddha.</description>

      <description>Introduction: There was a moment in world history where the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s teachings greatly affected world diplomacy during the Peace Treaty of 1951. We can learn from this type of history and apply the solution in our daily lives. In short, we can stop hatred with loving-kindness.&#xA;President J.R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka exits from a helicopter and walks to his airplane for departure after a state visit.&#xA;If you look at the history of the San Francisco Treaty of 1951, you will see that it officially negotiated the end of the war crimes with Japan from WWII.</description>

      <description>When it comes to shaving heads, Theravāda Buddhist Monks might be the authority on this issue. It is second nature for monks to shave but perhaps unknown to the rest of the world. In this article, we will discuss the motivation, Buddhist culture and methods for shaving the head and how it is done.&#xA;Simplicity Inspires But Also Saves Money: For those of you in the layperson world (man or woman) who aspire to become monks but cannot plunge into a monastery just yet, you might want to try cutting your hair very short before shaving it.</description>

      <description>Autopsy Table found on Wikipedia. The table we saw did not have &amp;ldquo;containment walls&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Is it true that forest monks actually attend autopsies? Yes it is actually quite common. After being a monk for perhaps more than 10 years, I remember a senior monk expressing surprise when he discovered I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen one. He said, “You haven’t been to an autopsy yet?”&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You haven&amp;rsquo;t been to an autopsy yet?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>A lay person named Chathuranga came to the International Institute of Theravāda looking to ordain in November, 2022. He is now a sāmaṇera (novice monk) and not yet a fully ordained bhikkhu. I thought that it would be interesting to show his path to monkhood to you.&#xA;Stage 1: Regular Person First he was a regular lay person working as a construction assistant engineer in the Maldives and then made the transition to a devoted layperson.</description>

      <description>Ven Ananda with the two donors&#xA;Recently, we received six new tables arranged by a monk&amp;rsquo;s two donors. The tables were nice but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we needed them, so I asked the monk why. He said there was not enough room on the tables for his donors&amp;rsquo; donations, so they decided to donate more tables so they can donate more. When his donors make donations, they are not small.</description>

      <description>Monk walking towards the world of the 5%&#xA;If you are a Westerner and new to Buddhism, you might be surprised to learn that most monks use and handle money. I have calculated that around 95% use money while 5% do not use money. The general consensus of those I have consulted say that about 2 or 3 percent do not use money but I used a 5% number to be safe.</description>

      <description>monks seated for the patimokkha recitation in Pa-Auk Mawlamyine&#xA;Introduction One of the things that you may notice when you visit a Buddhist monastery is that the monks sit, eat, walk, and pay respect to each other in a certain order. This order is based on the principle of seniority, which is determined by the date of ordination, not by age, education, or social status. Whoever is ordained earlier is considered senior, and whoever is ordained later is considered junior.</description>

      <description>Buddha by Numbers&#xA;Introduction The Buddhist teachings are often organized by various lists. Various matrices of interlinked lists to organize the teachings are one of the distinctive features of Buddhism. In my studies, I find myself learning many different types of lists for memory. By doing so, I can see the benefit and how they can be expanded and interlinked. While it may seem like dry minutia and uninteresting at first glance, the lists run very deep when you start to understand how the whole system works.</description>

      <description>Although Buddhist lay people might be interested in having a monk perform their marriage ceremony, it is not allowed and doing so is classed as a heavy rule (Saṅghādisesa). Such heavy rules have penalties and require the monk to lose his full status for a minimum of 6 nights[mfn]mānatta[/mfn] and additional probation time if concealing the offense occurs.&#xA;Image was created by AI DALL-E by openai.

      <description>Introduction: While I&amp;rsquo;m sure most religions do not particularly like the tradition of Halloween, I thought it would be good to explain why Halloween is not good according to Theravāda Buddhism.&#xA;Celebrating Halloween in modern times, regardless of the reasons why it was started in the first place, consists of dressing up in costumes. In celebration, you either dress up or you praise other people&amp;rsquo;s costumes. It is mostly bad karma for the one dressing up and if you praise that, it is not good either.</description>

      <description>Bowl with bowl stand (maybe Pa-Auk)&#xA;There are certain characteristics of the Theravada Buddhist monk&amp;rsquo;s bowl that might be interesting to know, even though the information is quite dry. Enjoy!&#xA;Material: The Buddha has allowed two different types of materials for bowls: iron and clay. When we say iron in Asia, we mean steel. Stainless steel is called steel. Is stainless steel allowed? This metal was not invented yet, but The Buddha left us with the great standards to judge if something should be allowable that was not mentioned during the time of the Buddha.</description>

      <description>Water Purification Diagram&#xA;While the first step of meditation is called Sīlavisuddhi (Purification of morality), another important part of our monastery is the water purification system. We basically have our own industrial Reverse Osmosis water purification plant with enough capacity to supply a whole village with drinking water. However, since we normally have 500+ residents, we only supply our own monastery instead of going into business.&#xA;Ven Kāruṇika is one of the worker monks who keeps our water filtration machine in tip top condition, or shall we say &amp;ldquo;purerr-ing&amp;rdquo; ?</description>

She went into the kitchen and then to the &amp;ldquo;walk-in refrigerator.&amp;rdquo; I just had to laugh and then snapped a picture.&#xA;What does a walk-in refrigerator look like? How doe they make walk-in refrigerators in Myanmar Monasteries? Instructions: Take an eight by eight room, Lay the walls with tiles Insulation (optional) Put one or two air conditioners inside Pa-Auk Maymyo: Only 1 air conditioner.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my childhood favorite board games made by MAD Magazine. Unlike other games, the object of the game was to lose all of your money.&#xA;In the last post, it was mentioned that the majority of Theravāda monks use money even though it is clearly not allowed, is a form of disrespect and defiance to the Buddha wishes and because of the moment to moment accumulation nature of using money or things bought with money, it adds up just like the drops of rain fill rivers which in turn fill up the oceans.</description>

      <description>A Money tree in Laos cc-by-attrib-sa https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Buddhist_money_tree_with_toilet_paper.jpg&#xA;Are Buddhist monks allowed to use money? The short answer is that monks are definitely not allowed to even touch money for all traditions; Theravāda, Mahayāna, and Tibetan. However, it is very common for monks to not only accept money from lay people without shame, but they even encourage lay people to offer the money. Nevertheless, it is still a rule and there are heavy consequences if this becomes a lifetime habit and a wrong mode of livelihood.</description>

For his birthday, he determined to offer 100 shoulder cloths to various monks and ended up making 123. What is a shoulder cloth? It is a small robe that monks often like to wear underneath their upper robe.&#xA;from http://www.justwalkedby.com/2016/03/sweeping-monk/ creative commons attrib nc&#xA;We have an abundance of robes in the storage room and with vassa coming up, we will get more and more.</description>

      <description>https://unsplash.com/photos/j3R9C-Xqe1w&#xA;Warning: This is a long but clear and interesting religious post on what happens after death according to Classical Theravāda Buddhism.&#xA;Key Points: The Fully Enlightened do not take a rebirth after death. Immediate rebirth takes place after the death moment for all other beings. Kamma is what determines your next birth Lifetime and Momentary suffering Be careful what you wish for There is no such thing as a guaranteed intermediate stage (Bardo Plane).</description>

When we give water to the Bodhi Tree, it is not uncommon to give pure bottled drinking water to it. Yes, you read that correctly.&#xA;Bottled drinking water is used to water a tree.</description>

He had read my previous article on Buddhist Monk&amp;rsquo;s Robes Information and wanted to interview me for another Buddhist robes article for Patheos.com. We talked for quite a long time about Buddhism, my past, and why I ordained, and then the time was up. So we scheduled another call to talk about robes the next day to actually talk about the robes.</description>

When lunch came, we were on high alert. Massive testing happened within the next few days and we went from 12 positive cases to 25 and then to 35 and now we are at 50 cases for the male size and 15 for the female side only one week later.</description>

      <description>Sayadaw holding one of his finished brooms&#xA;Natural fiber brooms are quite common in Theravadan countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Laos. Since the plants that are used to make brooms grow in our monastery, one of our very senior monks takes pleasure in making brooms when he needs to stretch his legs after a long meditation. It is strange, but since our main job is to meditate, working can be a leisure activity!</description>

Sayadawgyi was young back then and used to climb the stairs to his mountain kuti twice per day. I will miss that.&#xA;The title was meant to play with the name of Sayadawgyi&amp;rsquo;s famous book called, &amp;ldquo;Knowing and Seeing.&amp;rdquo; The book is referring to knowing and seeing the detailed Dhammas which were once thought impossible to know and literally &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I recited the 227 rules of the Pātimokkha for 110 bhikkhus at Pa-Auk Meditation Center in Pyin Oo Lwin. When a monk recites the Pātimokkha, traditionally he does so by memory and not by reading. My recitation was not the best quality, but it was not so bad considering I only started when I was 47, and I have only done this 5 times now. However, the recitations get better and better each time I do it and I hope improvement continues until perfection.</description>

      <description>Very few people from the West know about what the monks use for their bath towels and their bathing soap. Monks use items that are much different than those found in the West, although commonly known in Myanmar and other Buddhist countries. Furthermore, the monks use these items because of the monk rules associated with them in addition to the abundance and low cost.&#xA;Monks at Pa-Auk usually use small hand towels instead of normal &amp;ldquo;wrap-around&amp;rdquo; sized towels.</description>

What does this mean and is that proper?&#xA;The answer is: What you see on Facebook is not proper for monks or nuns. What you see on the news with monks and nuns as protesters is not proper. Overturning a bowl is an official Buddhist act, but what you have seen on Facebook and on the news are not official acts of overturning a bowl.</description>

However, it is a useful brute force method for memorizing Pali texts and the only way to memorize longer word for word Pāḷi texts such as the Pātimokkha. This system is used extensively in Myanmar schools and Myanmar study monasteries. If you hear lots of noise in the classrooms, rote learning is what they are doing.</description>

To help with Buddhist literacy, I made a basic video that helps people memorize The Noble Eightfold Path in English.</description>

      <description>Irrawaddi River, Bagan, 2015&#xA;There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about what the Abhidhamma is all about. If I were to describe a river based on Suttanta values and then describe it again in terms of Abhidhamma and commentary values, Abhidhamma will be very clear in its validity and purpose. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall the Buddha explaining rivers in Suttas in the way I will explain them. However, I will try to explain them &amp;ldquo;as if&amp;rdquo; they were spoken in the Suttas and also &amp;ldquo;as if&amp;rdquo; they were mentioned in the Abhidhamma and Commentaries.</description>

During Kaṭhina, a set of robes are offered, but usually just the lower and upper robes since the double robe or outer robe lasts a long time.</description>

It was because of this massacre that The Buddha made a rule about killing humans. For the first 20 years, there were no rules and this was the third rule that was ever created. Before this, the monks intuitively knew what was proper and there was no need for rules.</description>

      <description>Burmese Pāḷi&#xA;I have made a list of the most basic Pāḷi terms which will help you in your Theravāda Buddhist Readings and listening to Dhamma Talks. I could have added more, but there are already 165+ terms. I have decided to sort the words in alphabetical order so I would not have to decide which were the most important. Grouping the words would have also given me the same dilemma.</description>

      <description>Only In The West, Only In Asia&#xA;Different Cultures, Different Views Many Westerners don’t understand or appreciate the old Buddhist texts or teachings. They are very different from Asian culture and history. They find it hard to relate to them.&#xA;Let me give you an example. This is a picture and story of a bidet (a device that sprays water to clean your private parts after using the toilet).</description>

      <description>Injection on Western resident monk&#xA;Pa-Auk finally vaccinated 2000 of its residents across its branch monasteries with a privately sponsored SinoPharm vaccine. Pa-Auk Pyin Oo Lwin branch had its vaccines delivered on September 18th, 2021 with about half of the total population signed up. Vaccination was voluntary and provided by donors.&#xA;While it did take a long time for us to get the vaccine, the government did invite us for the vaccine back in April or May 2021.</description>

      <description>Recently I made a mobile app to help me know when the Solar Noon is approaching and past.&#xA;Why Is the Sun Important for Bhikkhus? Why Is The Sun Important for 8 &amp;amp; 10 Precepts? If you are a monk, nun or a practicing yogi who has vowed to not eat after Noon, you will benefit from this app. The real Solar Noon is not 12:00 pm when it comes to the Buddhist rules because there were no clocks back then.</description>

My goal was to eventually work at WTC, but luckily I didn&amp;rsquo;t get that job and it was the only job interview I didn&amp;rsquo;t get an offer on.</description>

      <description>cc0 picture https://pxhere.com/en/photo/489726&#xA;There is not much written in English explaining why bhikkhuni ordinations are rejected by the Theravāda Community of Monks. The English writings are a poor representation of the vast majority of Buddhist Scholarship and that is why there is &amp;ldquo;controversy&amp;rdquo; regarding the revival of the extinct Theravāda Bhikkhuni order. There is really no controversy to speak about once you know the full story.&#xA;Many Westerners believe that women are not able to become nuns without such a revival, but that is not true.</description>

We all know this formula as the explanation for how nuclear energy works, but we really don&amp;rsquo; t know much more than that.&#xA;For my one of my birthdays, I asked a monk who was once a nuclear engineer from Chernobyl to explain to me how it works.</description>

Even when Google shows you &amp;ldquo;free pictures,&amp;rdquo; sometimes, they require an account or were not really free in the first place. As a monk, even with our timeless Buddha, I still respect copyrights and encourage others to do the same. That is also one of the reasons why I use Linux as my main operating system.</description>

      <description>Recently, I got a nice message from a monk friend telling me he was taking vassa (3 month Rainy Season Retreat) on July 23rd (the Full Moon Day) and wishing me a happy vassa before he goes offline for three months. However, we at Pa-Auk are taking the vassa today on July 24 (the day after the Full Moon Day). The calendars often say it starts on the Full Moon Day, but we don&amp;rsquo;t do that at Pa-Auk.</description>

      <description>Did the Buddha do intermittent fasting? The answer is: Yes.&#xA;When I first became a monk, people were shocked about how I gave up eating after Solar Noon and I have not eaten dinner in over 20 years. Sometimes I switch to one meal per day, but I often find a light breakfast, mostly liquid foods or rice soup, with a full lunch works best for me. These days, many people are using intermittent fasting as a form of weight loss and when I describe my Buddhist monk diet, they give a nod and say &amp;ldquo;Intermittent Fasting&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s Healthy.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had a serious medical problem that had the potential to be extremely serious. Please don&amp;rsquo;t ask. In any case, I arranged permission to go outside and then arranged for someone to help me get to a clinic in Mandalay which had the proper technology to properly assess my problem. This article is not about going out. Instead this article is about coming back and staying in quarantine.&#xA;Because we do not have monastery-wide vaccines yet, Pa-Auk is quite strict about letting people go outside because when you come back, you will need to be on a 3 week quarantine before testing for your release.</description>

      <description>cc0 picture&#xA;Recently, there have been some instances in the news of monks who have been accused of rape or consensual sex. One monk appears to have supported a child with his money. While we won&amp;rsquo;t know the true outcome until an admission of guilt is made, we should investigate what is a rule and what is not a rule. Although it is appalling that the Catholic church allows its priests to continue in the order even after such admissions of guilt for sexual acts, the Buddhist rules across all Buddhist schools have a different approach.</description>

      <description>If you go to a Theravada Buddhist forest monastery in Asia, you are likely to find a full skeleton or parts of a skeleton somewhere where it can be viewed easily. Some monasteries also have cemeteries inside the boundary like Pa-Auk Forest Monastery in Mawlamyine. Some other monasteries have a place were dead bodies are burned (with open wood fires), right on the premises, like Pa-Auk Mawlamyine and also Wat Pa Nanachat in Thailand.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been getting a few messages wishing me safety and wellbeing with the current news floating around the world about events in Myanmar. I can assure you that our lives have not changed much even with the pandemic. Yes, we have been locked down for nearly a year or maybe longer, but monastery life is pretty much the monastery life. The only thing that is different is we wear masks around other monks who seem to care about masks and lately that mask population has been less and less.</description>

Although I am only 14 vassa because of a re-ordination ceremony, this day means more to me than my very own birthday. This day was also the day I got my name.&#xA;Today, I not only have the monk name Bhikkhu Subhūti, but I also have an actual legal passport name of Bhante Bhikkhu Subhuti as well as other essential ID&amp;rsquo;s too.</description>

Why is that?&#xA;Some people might question why Pa-Auk Forest Monastery and Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadaw have the same names. Did the Pa-Auk Sayadaw name his monastery after himself to immortalize his name? Is this an ego trip? What is the who, what, were, when, why, and how of this story?&#xA;Who?

      <description>What qualities make up the real Buddha Statues? There are certain qualities of a Buddha that makes one instantly recognizable from afar. There are many features that make the Buddha a Buddha besides the iconic drooping earlobes. From time to time, I see statues of the Buddha that are just not right. When you know the correct signs of The Buddha, you immediately know that something is wrong. While you cannot fool a Sri Lankan, you can fool others from all parts of the world.</description>

      <description>In 1993, I visited China with five lucky School of Technology students at my University. Before going, I asked around for some cool things to say and &amp;ldquo;Chī le ma?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Have you eaten yet?&amp;rdquo; was the phrase I learned besides asking for the toilet. It does not mean what it literally says. Instead, it means a little bit like &amp;ldquo;How are you?&amp;rdquo;, but more casual like, &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s it going?</description>

Take notice of the large quantities of food that are cooked on wood fired stoves.</description>

It fed approximately 530 yogis across four sections in Pa-Auk Forest Monastery. But how is that possible for monks to donate money?</description>

However, during jhāna, he says that there is no perception of light. He says that &amp;ldquo;The nimitta is the gateway to jhāna, but not the object of jhāna itself. Pīti or sukha are the objects of jhāna&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;If you follow Ajahn Brahm, this article will help you follow his teachings better.

A few months ago, I was really happy about it but then as health problems piled up a few weeks ago (which ended up being a 2.5 week allergic reaction), I was unpleasantly reminded that our bodies were only given 40-year warranties and I was ten years overdue. As I told my parents this newly discovered truth that a birthday just means I&amp;rsquo;m getting older with more problems and eventually death, my father said, &amp;ldquo;Bhante, we have been 30 years ahead of you with this same stuff.</description>

However in the Buddhist world, it is referred to as yāgu in the Pāḷi Language. It occurs many many times in the tipiṭaka (more than 500 times) and it is still eaten today in Asia and Southeast Asia.&#xA;To make it, you simply boil and then simmer one part rice with eight parts water for one or two hours.</description>

When a drop of dye is dropped in a glass of water, a ball will form and sink to the bottom. At that point, the dye master will empty that batch of dye into containers and then reboil the same chips with fresh water to make more dye.</description>

      <description>Pabbajja Ordination in Pa Auk (8th April 2014)&#xA;The short answer is: If you are looking for vinaya (places that don&amp;rsquo;t touch money), and you believe in the commentaries and Abhidhamma and want to meditate, you have two choices, Pa-Auk and Na-Uyana. If you don&amp;rsquo;t believe in the commentaries and Abhidhamma, you are best off at a Thai Forest Monastery like Ajahn Chah (Mahanikaya) or Ajahn Maha Boowa (Dhammayut) monasteries.</description>

      <description>I remember when I was living in Kaua&amp;rsquo;i in a tent propped up in the corner of my friend Uncle Gene Taylor&amp;rsquo;s property. I had just come home from my daily alms round and I popped into his room to say hello. He is old and has difficulty walking, yet he is usually quite cheerful. As part of the visit routine, he asked me how my day was and I smiled and happily said, &amp;ldquo;Today was a great day.</description>

      <description>It occured to me that people don&amp;rsquo;t know one type of Buddhist monk from the other and a post was needed to explain this.&#xA;First a little bit of history. Theravada is the closest thing as one can get to the original form of Buddhism and is based on the Pali texts. The countries that have Theravada as their national religion are; Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia. It dates back to the Buddha from 5th century BCE Later, came Mahayana - Chinese Buddhism of the 1st century BCE.</description>

      <description>Please note: this was written in 2020 but also applies to 2023. Vassa starts on August 1, 2023.&#xA;There seems to be confusion about when vassa is this year. This year is a special year and Vassa starts the day after the full moon day in August. The full moon day is August 3rd and Vassa starts on August 4th.&#xA;However, there are some traditions that believe that Vassa has already started with the full moon day of July 4th and Vassa on July 5th.</description>

      <description>Today, as I was washing my bowl, I saw a local Myanmar monk with a swastika tattoo on his arm. As an American and someone with Jewish bloodlines, I am still not used to this no matter how much I know. However, it is important topic for all of you who are new to Buddhism or even for some seasoned Buddhists.&#xA;Was the monk a racist? No. It is an ancient symbol which often means conducive to well being.</description>

      <description>While I have said quite a lot to inspire people about life as a monk around the world. I should give you both sides of the story to be fair.&#xA;When you think about living in Asia full-time or just for a visit, the first thought that comes to mind is, &amp;ldquo;Will I get sick?&amp;rdquo;. It can happen, and when you rely on volunteers and health standards that work &amp;ldquo;most of the time&amp;rdquo; but not all of the time, then problems can arise.</description>

      <description>A kuṭi is a small hut or lodging that a monk lives in and it is one of the basic four requisites: Robes, Food, Lodging, &amp;amp; Medicine. They come in various sizes and qualities and I have prepared a small showcase of pictures which can show more than just the words. We are supposed to reflect on the utilitarian purpose of the lodging, also called senāsana. Before we begin, here is a small sample of the morning chanting monks must chant everyday.</description>

As a monk, I try to stay away from basic web internet except one day per week, but I still hear what goes on and as of today, April 6th, 2020, Myanmar has 21 cases and one death. The number grows slowly in the beginning as you all might know and it is uncertain what will become of the virus in weeks to come.</description>

      <description>Having Fun At The Pa-Auk Dentist Clinic (Repost/refurbish from June, 2015*)&#xA;Because dentists are very expensive in America and the Pa-Auk dental clinic has pretty good sanitary conditions (for Myanmar), I went for a checkup before my trip to Hawai&amp;rsquo;i. Usually in Asia, you only go to a dentist when there is pain but I had some sensitivity I wanted to get checked and I waited for the Saturday dentist who is known on the street as &amp;ldquo;the old retired dentist who takes his time and does a good job.</description>

      <description>reposted from https://withmetta.net (2016) . When a Buddhist monk says “sabbe satta,” that is a shorthand for metta practice. “Sabbe satta” means “all beings.”&#xA;One of my friend’s collects the leftover food and cakes and says or acts on this everyday after each meal at the Mudon Pa-Auk monastery. But in reality, even though he says “sabbe satta,” he really just seems to feed the birds with the leftover food and cakes.</description>

      <description>At Theravada monasteries there is no eating allowed after Noontime. Some monasteries only give one meal per day, while other monasteries give 2 meals per day. Both meal plans are allowed by the Buddha. However, some monasteries have no meals brought to the monks and they need to go out in the village and collect it. This last case is very rare and usually done by the forest monks living in secluded places or ehem.</description>

It was the happiest days of my life and the most important one besides successfully being born as a human and surviving any serious death or injuries. Although there was a small hiccup, it has been 19 years total. I had just finished arranging my residential visa that was said could not be changed from a tourist visa without leaving the country.</description>

Shortly after the Buddhist Rainy Season had begun in Kaua’i, the support for inviting a second monk fell through and I was tired of being alone which meant I needed to leave.&#xA;Around the same time, in late July or early August, my Lao/American supporter named Thongvanh, sent me brochure with a monk who was leading a “Spiritual Sri Lanka Trip” which included the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree in Anuradhapura.</description>

      <description>My family&#xA;I did a brief visit with my parents on the corner of October and November. Although I have stayed separately at my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house on the previous last two visits in 2006 and 2008, I had arranged for the porch-sun-room to be modified as a &amp;ldquo;separate lodging&amp;rdquo; for me in 2019. If you do the math, that means I have not visited Connecticut in eleven years. This in-house lodging arrangement worked out and instead of being 60 miles away and only getting a few visits in with my folks, I was able to spend some good quality time with them during the majority of my week long stay.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had a chance to go to a Lao Monastery in Elgin, Chicago, IL, USA for 12 days. I usually avoid American Theravada Temples like the plague because most of these places have monks who use money and much of the monk life is centered around collecting money. This is a typical standard not only in America but in most countries. This monastery however, is different.&#xA;In 2015, the committee decided to stop being a useless, unwholesome temple that teaches wrong dhammavinaya (teaching and training &amp;mdash; on wrong ways to give donation and wrong ways to make merit, and obviously wrong kamma and results).</description>

      <description>I recently turned 49 and I found some old pictures of myself that I thought I would share. It is very difficult to get older pictures of myself because it was before the digital picture revolution. In those days, we used to hire (through a helper) the man known as &amp;ldquo;photoman&amp;rdquo; who had a camera and would take one single picture and then sell the prints for about $1 each. It was very expensive for locals to develop a whole role of film and this was how it was done.</description>

      <description>This past July, I had an old friend named Ian Sloan (previously Venerable Visarada ) visit me in Kauai. He disrobed after being a monk for 25 years. He disrobed because of a conflict of philosophy about what happens at death. It was a combination of accounts from past life regressions in hypnotherapy, what he has read by Edgar Cayce, and the event of his father&amp;rsquo;s death. He seems to appreciate the Near Death Experiences which can still be explained partially with Buddhism, but he felt it was time to disrobe.</description>

      <description>Every so often on my alms rounds, or here and there, I encounter Christians who approach me. Usually within the first sentence, they announce themselves as Christians to me as if they were holding a cross near to my face. However, I listen to their questions and give them answers. Many times they are trying to convince me my path is wrong and since it is a predictable pattern for them, I can anticipate what they will say, and put logic into their own path.</description>

It is not easy to manage so many donors with big hearts to give. Most of the time, I am giving hand signals to get less food. You might want to play this at double speed.</description>

Is there an exchange that takes place with the things you receive?&#xA;The video includes stories on how alms works, the blessings that I give and how people benefit by giving. One story recounts how I went for alms close to the time where we cannot eat and how generous and beautiful the Myanmar people can be.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was interviewed from an old friend who was previously a monk with me in Pa-Auk, Mawlamyine, Myanmar. Nikita was a monk for about one year before disrobing. He asked me about what it is like for a monk without money to go for alms in Kauai, Hawaii, USA. I have been doing this for about one year now, and I tell a couple of stories which are fun to listen to.</description>

      <description>I recently changed my name officially to Bhante Bhikkhu Subhuti. I have been wanting to do this for a very long time but, unfortunately, I was unable to do it because the name change process has to be done in the probate court where one has residency. Since I had spent most of my time in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, it was just not possible, until recently. After being in Hawaii for a while, I committed to staying for at least three months longer to complete the name change process.</description>

      <description>This is where I live&#xA;Wow! Today is February 7th and another year has passed. I have now completed 18 years total as a monk and I am working on my 19th year. Of course, my monk age is 12 rainy seasons because I changed Nikayas after my 6th year. I have been living my monk life in Kauai, Hawaii for about 10 months now and things have been moving along.</description>

      <description>On a warm Hawaiian Christmas day in 2018, I was off to collect my alms in the village. I was in a rush and worried that I would not be able to find a ride to the village where I go for alms because so few cars would be on the roads. Luckily, I got a ride and as I stepped out of the the car, I did my usual baggage check.</description>

We all had fun doing it. It will give you a good taste of what we did on the island in 2015 and what I am doing now. I often enjoy revisiting this recording, and I hope you do too.&#xA;[archiveorg id=oasis111518-2]</description>

      <description>Last week I taught Fingernail Meditation. This is where one uses the fingernail(s) as a subject of meditation. Although this has probably never been taught before by anyone as a standalone meditation subject, it is a subsection of a meditation instruction that all monks are given on their ordination day. That is called, &amp;ldquo;The First Five Body Parts,&amp;rdquo; Yes, it is that well known, but rarely ever or even never taught.</description>

For the Christians out there, they might say, “Doesn’t that make you believe in God?” My answer is, “It makes me believe there are heavenly beings (Devas &amp;amp; Devis)) who are looking out for me.”. There are other stories not included such as &amp;ldquo;My Watch Story&amp;rdquo;</description>

However things were changing and it was time for me to look for another place and now I am staying in a new long term location in Kilauea.&#xA;It all happened after a wonderful person picked me up on the side of the road holding my signs the day my parents, brother and in-law dropped me off (I’ll get back to that family-visit part later).</description>

      <description>I often recommend a free 10-day vipassana meditation course found at https://dhamma.org . Is it possible that there would be a 10-day meditation retreat that gives you food and lodging for free? Not only that, but would they refuse to accept money prior to taking such a 10-day meditation course? Is that possible? Of course it is possible! You see, they refuse to accept payments before you attend the course but allow you to donate for the next group after you finish.</description>

      <description>Below is a chart comparing special allowances by tradition which is useful for making a decision on where to ordain. If you need an explanation, read further..&#xA;There are some allowances and differences among traditions. I have included four traditions to the best of my knowledge about certain “allowances” that are allowed in some places and not allowed in other places. Who is right? Well, I believe that the two monasteries on the right (especially Wat Khao Sanamachai) are correct while other monks will believe that the monasteries on the left are correct.</description>

      <description>Monk bowls are black because they are fired with sesame oil 5 times to protect it from rusting. There are two types of bowls allowed; Iron and Clay. Iron bowls need to be fired 5 times and clay bowls only need firing twice. Obviously, the clay bowls do not need to be black in color but are rare to find because they are fragile and very very heavy. Iron bowls are black from the baked-on sesame oil.</description>

However, it was a good excuse to write this small article.

      <description>The Seeds From Long Ago I remember when I first learned how to meditate on my breath some time in 1990, during my university years. Back then, meditation was not so well known. The beat generation&amp;rsquo;s Zen trend in the 60&amp;rsquo;s had died out with disco in the 70&amp;rsquo;s. Barnes and Noble maybe had only a few shelves in a single bookcase labeled with &amp;ldquo;Eastern Philosophy&amp;rdquo; that covered all Eastern religions, including Buddhism.</description>

      <description>Why do monks have one shoulder exposed sometimes and both shoulders covered other times?&#xA;There is a very small rule about having the robes fully covered when we are in a populated areas (sekhiyā 3). Although it is a very small rule, it can say a great deal about the monk and his respect for the monastic code, especially in the afternoons or evenings.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Populated areas&amp;rdquo; refers to when we are outside of the monastery and outside of the forest.</description>

      <description>NOTE: This is a very brief version of the 25 page PDF on the subject. The free 25 page pdf download on the third precept is here. Theravada Buddhism and Sex (extended)&#xA;Summary: The third precept is defined as not having sex without the protector&amp;rsquo;s permission. It is that simple! However, the protector can be the parents, husband, guardian, brother, government, religious order, etc. You need the protector&amp;rsquo;s permission and often that is the parents in most cases.</description>

Lastly, it includes the stages of insight and wisdom that one needs to reach Nibbāna. Books do not get more complete than this.</description>

There are some restrictions though. I spoke with a lawyer who seemed to know civil liberties quite well, but there are no guarantees with what I say. However, this information should make sense and seem legal to you. It is legal to ring the doorbell of any house and preach to them or talk to them about politics under the freedom of speech rights.</description>

      <description>The Concept in Breath Meditation The concept of the breath as it is used in meditation is not well understood. We will discuss this matter in this small article. There are many methods concerned with the breath, but The Ancient Theravāda Commentaries say that one should focus at one area above the upper lip and at the exit of the nostrils. However, if one just limited himself to that one single method, things can still get complicated.</description>

      <description>Is the light a Nimitta and when should one look at it?&#xA;When one practices meditation based on the breath, it is possible for the light to come and when that happens and it is stable one can use that light to enter samadhi absorption concentration. However, one should know when to look at the light and when not to look at the light. It is very important to know this difference because progress can stop.</description>

Actually, there were several days of incredible amounts of rain, but only the third day broke the records. See https:www.washingtonpost.com&#xA;I was in a tent in Anini Park during that time and I am still in Anini Park.</description>

      <description>A’capella Inertia Audio Story (free MP3 download)&#xA;[archiveorg id=acapellainertia]&#xA;I have decided to make an audio version of this story. I started off by having a computer read this for the purpose of proofreading. Then I started reading it out loud. As I read it out loud with my own natural expressions, I thought that it might be better if an audio version were available.&#xA;I happen to have access to a good quality microphone and some professional Linux software running on Elementary OS.</description>

It has received high marks and it will take about 30 minutes to read.</description>

      <description>It seems like that time has come up again. Time surely does happen and so does my anniversary. Now it is 17 years! As usual, for the disclaimer, I am only 11 Vassa in official years. But Wow! Now it is finally starting to seem like a long time!&#xA;I have been blessed with a wonderful adult life. I worked as a professional for only about six years, got paid like a doctor, and felt relaxed and at ease the majority of the time that I worked.</description>

      <description>Vegetarianism and Theravada Buddhism I have been asked to write a little something on vegetarianism and Theravāda Buddhism. I am qualified to be quite objective, and to see both sides of the issue because I was a vegetarian for a total of ten years as a lay person and I had vegetarian eyes. That meant that when I looked at meat, cooked or not, I saw a dead animal in front of me.</description>

      <description>Inspire Means To Leave Facebook Much of what I write about is related to stories that happen to me that would charge me up and make me feel inspired. I would then write down what happened and share it with others. Often my stories are related to vinaya – the monks’ rules and living without money. These days it is special for a monk to live without money and I can inspire people simply by following the rules.</description>

      <description>When Ven. Devananda and I traveled to Kauai in 2015, we did not have a Kappiya (helper) to buy us food or even pay for our luggage. One can live without helpers, but it does take some pre-planning.&#xA;We had a ticket from Yangon to Honolulu that was dirt cheap at only $854 for a round trip fare. However, it came with 12 hour and 6 hour layovers in China.</description>

His biography books says it for sure.&#xA;Venerable Ācariya Mun Būridatta Thera is one of the most revered forest masters of the 20th century. He is the root guru of both the Dhammayut and Ajahn Chah monasteries. He popularized the monastic practice of living under an umbrella in the forest and his relentless energy is fascinating and inspiring.</description>

      <description>Here is a quick tip on how to make a filter in just a few minutes. Maybe as fast as one minute. This is useful for monks who want to put filters on their water taps. It is my own invention as far as I know, but I am sure other monks somewhere else also do the same. The Buddha did mention that if we did not have a filter, we could use the corner of our robes (that we are wearing).</description>

      <description>I Finally Did It! This Rainy Season (Vassa) I was able to learn the Pātimokkha (227 Rules) by heart. It is the first round and it takes me a long time to do it, and there are mistakes. Never the less, it is considered “learned” and “memorized” at this stage. I will hopefully recite the Pātimokkha for the full moon November 3rd if all goes well. I need to get my 2+ hours of recitation down to at least 1:15 minutes.</description>

Or is it something else?&#xA;Buddhist monks generally do a reflection and chant something before eating. In fact it is said that the monks incurs debt if they doe not reflect before eating. Actually, there are 4 reflections concerning the Four Requisites:&#xA;1. Robes</description>

      <description>Racism in Asia, Myanmar and Monasteries I remember when I came to Sri Lanka, in 2007 and I met a monk who said he was from Slovenia. “Slovenia? What kind of country is that?” I told him that I had memorized the world map in school, but I didn’t remember any “Slovenia.” There happened to be a large world map in the other room and he called me over to see it.</description>

      <description>The Buddha in the clouds&#xA;Does the Buddha Live in Nibbāna? Many people believe that the Buddha is alive and living in some sort of transcendental realm called Nibbāna where he can hear your prayers and eat and drink the food and water that you offer to Him. We Buddhist monks smile when we hear that people have such beliefs because nobody lives in Nibbāna, not even a Buddha.</description>

      <description>When should you give to Saṅgha?&#xA;When should you give to individual monks?&#xA;This is a question that is not addressed very often and it can cause lots of trouble for monks knowingly and unknowingly. Quite often, many monks blindly prompt donors to recite a line of pāḷi before they offer anything to them. “Bhikkhu Saṅghassa demi.” There are some variations, but that is the generic formula. It means, “I give to the community of monks.</description>

      <description>Why are most monasteries not allowable for vinaya monks? Today, I was Skyping my parents which is something we do once or twice a month now. I feel it is good for them to &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; me as a monk, rather than having them talk to me and visualizing their son from 1999. That was when I left home and things changed for me. We had a nice discussion. We spoke about possibilities for a visit, but I told them that finding a place was difficult, because the monks all use money and whatever they buy with that money becomes unallowable.</description>

      <description>I had the day off from school and went for alms today in a new area unannounced. I wanted to go down a side street near &amp;ldquo;shit- mile.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Shit-mile&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;8 mile marker&amp;rdquo; in the Myanmar language. So Before I went there, I saw an alley on the right with a small food-stall setup. Because it was a new area and nobody knew I was coming for alms, I need to explore every opportunity to collect enough food for my lunch, a meal that would need to last me until the next morning.</description>

It is my favorite part of the week. It is where I can stop being a college student and be more like the monk I prefer to be. Near the end of my meditation in the Pagoda, a large Vietnam group came and did a chanting procession circumnavigating the inside of the pagoda.</description>

He was in the hospital going through the first round of fighting lymphoma cancer. He asked about my planned one or two year journey and I told him about all of the places I would travel to. Then I said how I wanted to become a monk and that might happen near the end of the trip.</description>

The person who follows the 10 precepts is known as a novice monk. A bhikkhu follows 227 rules.&#xA;It is important to know these classes to know which rules are more important to follow. It also can explain, what class of rules a monk is following.</description>

      <description>Is it OK to feed uncooked rice to the birds?&#xA;Recently, the subject about feeding animals in my post Sabbe-Satta-Metta was brought up and how it could end up hurting animals in the long run. I answered it as &amp;ldquo;hogwash,&amp;rdquo; and then questioned the validity of the myth of throwing rice at weddings since I see people feed birds with uncooked rice all of the time in Burma. If it killed the birds, we would surely know about it and stop doing it.</description>

      <description>What do Theravada Buddhists believe in terms of abortion? Much of what has been written are liberal beliefs and overturning what is written down in the texts. They claim “Modern Buddhism” as a section heading, but there is no such thing as “Modern Buddhism” since there is no such thing as “Modern Kamma.” The rules of kamma do not change over time, and abortion has been around since the time of the Buddha.</description>

Ok .. Here is the story. I was on alms round two weeks ago and a regular supporter invited us to ask for anything for our studies at school. I needed some pens, so I asked for some pens. He told me to wait and showed up with a huge pen gift-box.</description>

      <description>Below is a Wrigley’s TV commercial from the 80s which started my lifelong dream to hang-glide and a genuine excuse to get educated. Whenever I saw this commercial as a child, my jaw was to the floor. It was something I had always wanted to do. Thanks to youtube, I can trace it all back.&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ87pBjQt0k&#xA;I was never really college material, I took the SAT’s once and bombed on them.</description>

      <description>Download Free A4 format PDF&#xA;Download Free A5 format PDF&#xA;Tutorial on How to Sit Many times I have given advice to yogis on how to sit properly and I have received raving success. In fact, I asked one fellow student to model for the pictures you will see in this article and he was absolutely amazed at how comfortable he was as soon as he sat down. He spoke loudly with joy and excitement as soon as he was seated in the Samādhi-Sausage, which prompted other people to peek inside the room to see what all of the commotion was about.</description>

      <description>A 2 part Powerpoint presentation about what two monks did in Kauai, Hawaii during June to December 2015. The theme was propagation, but the propagation was done just from being monks who do not touch money, and collect their food the traditional Buddhist monk way. The vision, how it got started, stories and experiences were shared. About 50 people were in the audience. Running time is about 1 hour total for both.</description>

      <description>Here is a sample video and written instructions for making a self-contained incense holder made from a plastic bottle. It is the coolest incense holder I have ever used. The idea is not mine. An American lay person had one at his dorm room and I thought it was the coolest thing since sliced bread. I made mine in minutes.&#xA;The Problem: No matter how you slice it, incense holders often let the ashes fall outside of the &amp;ldquo;catching-base.</description>

      <description>I had a really good day going for alms today. When it “rains it pours.” Although it rained today, I am talking about alms donations. I told myself, that if this village does not give (like usual), then I will skip it and find another one or stay with the shack village alone. After 3 weeks of only one donor in that village, I finally got some edible food&amp;hellip;. However, I accomplished that by going down some other side-roads I had started to skip.</description>

      <title>The Benefits of Faith Alms</title>

      <description>The benefits of “Faith piṇḍapata”. This is a term that I learned either in Abhayagiri, Ca, or Wat Pah Nanachat or both. Probably brought to the West from Ajahn Pasanno who is/was the abbot of both. This means that when you go on alms, you make a determination to only eat the alms food you collect. When you do something like this (and I am not sooo perfect when I follow these things), you can learn a lot about yourself and the real Buddhist teachings.</description>

      <description>I remember when I went to America in 2008 with one of my monastic friends named Ven. Visarada. He was an experienced monk and had good ascetic practices. When we went to America, he did not have any luggage and brought everything he owned with him. Instead of using luggage, he used a simple cardboard box. It is simple, easy to get, easy to dispose of and also more suitable for a monk than fancy luggage.</description>

      <description>I cannot believe that I am writing an article that explains how the monks are fighting over food. It is very awkward to hear isn’t it? On the other hand human nature is human nature. We have six monks who sit at each table and sometimes there is not enough of the special items to go around. And that is when the fighting begins&amp;hellip;&#xA;But it is not what you think.</description>

      <description>In the eight plus years that I have lived in Myanmar, I have never seen the Thingyan Water Festival festivities happening in the street. I normally spend my time in the monastery and normally, if I went on alms, it would be early in the morning. However, our Kyownpine monastery goes out on alms round a little later so we can collect real food to actually eat a little bit easier (so the donors have time to cook).</description>

The Yorgo Sayadaw read my first ordination transaction 15 years ago and invited me to come. He speaks no English, but we have fun together. Such a lovely place, lots of Metta here. Good views, cool at night (75 degrees), nice kuti. This place is suitable for foreigners to live at complete with proper vinaya (monks&amp;rsquo; rules).</description>

      <description>Here is a video slideshow of my Bagan trip. We had scheduled 8 full days to travel around, and mostly on foot. We had a limited budget and it was a real joy. Basically, the less transportation you have, the more you can take in. However, you need time to do that. Ven Pannyagavesaka went with me. He likes to take pictures and I like to wander around. It was a good match.</description>

There was a lady on a bicycle who approached us and asked us what we were doing. Her tone of voice was not so happy, but we enjoy telling people what we are doing because it does not happen so often and that is one of our goals when we stand in front of each house.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, we got some pre-Halloween candy during our alms round at one of the houses. I thought that was very &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo; of our donor.&#xA;Halloween is a holiday on October 31, in America where kids dress up as, well, anything they want. They go around the neighborhood at night and ring the doorbells and say &amp;ldquo;Trick or treat!&amp;rdquo;. Then the person at the house would place some candy inside the ambitiously sized candy collection bags.</description>

      <description>The website Http://TimeAndDate.com is a &amp;ldquo;must-know&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;must-have&amp;rdquo; for Buddhist monks, especially when they travel abroad. It calculates the Moon Phases and Solar Noon for a specific area. One thing that was very enlightening was how the Western calendars were off from the Buddhist calendars for the new and full moons.&#xA;Why?&#xA;Well&amp;hellip; pick a place in the East, like Yangon and see when the full moon is. Then pick a place in the far West like Honolulu and see when the full moon is.</description>

Being the nice monk I am, I let us stay and we meditated on the mountain until it got dark.</description>

      <description>I am still happy to report that things are continuing to go well. However, we did have a small hiccup, OK, a big one. We moved.&#xA;Yes, I know it was beautiful place we had, and maybe the most beautiful place in Kauai too. But something was just not right and so we decided to move out and we are in a new place on a three acre tropical fruit orchard.</description>

      <description>These days, most meditators meditate inside buildings on flat and hard surfaces. One should try to meditate outside on a nice grassy area that has a 20 to 30° angle. It does not take much to find such a place and if you do, you might feel there is no need for pillows or other bulky equipment for your comfort. Go ahead and give it a *try!&#xA;Wrapping a robe or a bedsheet around your body can reduce the need for bug spray.</description>

      <description>There is a Bodhi Tree on our property and we sometimes do a vandana (chanting) in front of this tree rather than at the gazebo. We did one tonight until a passing rain cloud sprinkled on us.&#xA;From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi_Tree The Bodhi Tree, also known as Bo (from Sinhalese: Bo) and &amp;ldquo;peepal tree&amp;rdquo; in Nepal and Bhutan, was a large and very old sacred fig tree (Ficus religiosa[1])[2] located in Bodh Gaya, India, under which Siddhartha Gautama, the spiritual teacher later known as Gautama Buddha, is said to have attained enlightenment, or Bodhi.</description>

      <description>Our third beach trip with chanting and meditation during sunset. Lumaha&amp;rsquo;i Beach. We walked to the center of the beach and then sat down on top of a sand ledge to do our chanting. Afterwards, we did our meditation until a small rain cloud started to sprinkle down upon us. We had a good Dhamma discussion with our driver who is eager to learn about Buddhism and meditation and often asks us when the next trip will happen.</description>

      <description>Report on Kauai&#xA;I am pleased to write you with a very happy report on our trip to Kauai. We have been doing really good work and things have been working out well. My concepts and ideas about Kauai as a special place for monks to live and practice has met and and exceeded my expectations. I feel it is very good for my overall monk life and development. Instead of relying on a big monastery structure for my needs, I need to keep on my toes in order to survive.</description>

Such a beautiful Island, and I really have not explored much because it is so satisfying where I am already. Yesterday was our one-month anniversary.&#xA;This was posted on Google+</description>

      <description>I went to Waimea canyon today. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea_Canyon_State_Park I think it was the most beautiful place I had ever seen or tied to seeing the whales jumping out of the ocean at the 8 mile cliff campsite from the kalalau trail fifteen years ago. All that said, they are both found on Kauai. The pictures are great, but disappointingly flat. The last picture was Polihale beach.&#xA;This was posted on Google+</description>

      <description>Our bus passes start on July 1. However, Kauai is easy to hitchhike on. To make things difficult, I do not want to use my thumb and just let people guess. The result?&#xA;It is really easy and I regret having passes, although it is easy that way.&#xA;Today we got a ride from someone who went to Kula High School where I used to teach in 2000. She knew our road and drove us door to door.</description>

      <description>If anyone is interested in reading up on great organization. This one seems to be very good. I have read their newsletters for quite a while. There were some things I ethically opposed to and do not recommend, but for disaster relief (and that is my focus of praise), they are quite high. They are in Nepal now and often at every place where disaster strikes. I am most impressed in their way they deliver goods to victims.</description>

I got the green light for air tickets and other things. I just need to get the visa for my Sri Lankan monastic friend who agreed to come. If this visa gets approved, I will be even more happy!</description>

      <description>Original picture lost, but this one from Thailand will do.&#xA;They might be Giants&#xA;During this time, called, &amp;ldquo;The Water Festival&amp;rdquo; many &amp;ldquo;young and old&amp;rdquo; take robes temporarily. It is the &amp;ldquo;summer&amp;rdquo; equivalent like we have in the West. No School.&#xA;Recently, a foreigner friend disrobed a few days ago. I think he was on his second or third year. He was the ideal monk, quite passive, talks only when you need him to, quiet most of the time and fairly progressed in meditation too (with pa-auk standards).</description>

      <description>Before and After Water Filter&#xA;I have been using this water filter for about a month or so now. It is working well and I have not had brown water days yet! I was going to leave because of the water and my ear problems which has now turned into Tinnitus. That is not fun when you meditate as your main gig. I asked a friend of mine, U Jotika who had offered a filter for me long ago when he showed me around his new kuti which also had a filter.</description>

      <description>The Old Fashion Fire-Line Method&#xA;Without a concrete truck, you need many volunteers to work in a concrete fire-line to pour concrete. Bucket by bucket, the task gets completed. I have never seen or heard of any other method used for any of the buildings at Pa-auk. This project is for Sayadawkyi&amp;rsquo;s new meeting room which will be attached to his newest kuti at Pa-Auk Tawya. His first kuti, made from bamboo has been torn down and replaced with a new three story 80 room dormitory.</description>

Next to relationships and my guitar, or maybe ahead of them, Kauai is my lost love in life and I can touch it too!</description>

I had my doubts, so I asked the driver to open up the hood. It was in fact, a Toyota engine block. Consumers, please be careful!&#xA;In the olden days there were very high taxes on cars. I think 200% tax which made used cars hold their value well.</description>

The support and gratitude exchange is worth noting although it is not so uncommon for Myanmar people to go out of their way to make guests feel warm and welcome.</description>

(The active ingredients of such shampoos are often antifungal)&#xA;Albendazole is another remedy for itchiness at the other end of the body, usually at night, commonly called worms. The itchiness comes from the female worms who wriggle their way outside to lay their eggs.????</description>

      <description>Razors and Switchblades&#xA;These are the types of razors that most monks use in Myanmar. I used one of these for about eight years with one of the sides modified so it did not having the safety bar. We called the sides; &amp;ldquo;safety side&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;dangerous side.&amp;rdquo; With the dangerous side, one can wait a week or even 4 weeks before shaving. The safety bar is what causes the blade to clog and the &amp;ldquo;dangerous side&amp;rdquo; removes &amp;ldquo;clogging&amp;rdquo; from the formula.</description>

It may not be immediately easy to see why it was important, yet we all have a story where it means more to you than others, for reasons of personal interpretation and circumstance. This story reflects on the joy of giving, encourages giving, and the idea of relinquishment.</description>

      <description>This is a picture of today&amp;rsquo;s Alms round at the villages surrounding Varanasi Monastery. The rice is put into the bowls and the curries are collected separately by the helpers or our young monks. The meals are given to the monks using this food and other supplementary food.

      <description>I too had this problem when I flew to the USA on British Airways in 2008, but I have never delayed a plane for this problem. Actually, it was my monastic friend who was travelling with me who was put next to a woman. Unfortunately, although I made sure a note about seating was inside our reservations, the reservation notes do not get sent up to the plane. I am not sure why special reservation instructions do not get sent to the plane, but that is the policy, and take heed if you are a monk or you send your kid on a plane with fatal food allergies.</description>

      <description>I am staying a Varanasi Monastery. It is a monastery that follows the rules closely. There are many adorable little monks here, about 25. There are about 15 adult monks too. This place is a Nepalese monastery with Nepalese immigrants. Some are several generations, but they have still retained their language. Teaching is done in Myanmar language. There are approximately 300,000 Nepalese people living in Myanmar today.&#xA;The first photo is the planned monastery.</description>

      <description>Oily food anyone?&#xA;Pa-Auk Foreigners are prepared special foreigner food because the local food often looks like this. However, unknown to most foreigners, the local monks do not get much curry with their full scoop of rice. The curried oil is often used to flavor the rice (&amp;ldquo;meal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rice&amp;rdquo; are the same words in parts of Asia). It is similar to flavoring popcorn with butter. However, the Western eating style is to eat the curry as the meal and then the rice, often eaten separately.</description>

      <description>A donor as the nuns resceive rice in Pa-Auk Village&#xA;A few times per year, as part of a tradition, the whole monastery goes to the village to collect raw rice. The monks are assisted by school children who act as helpers since monks are not allowed to touch food that will be used for a later date. The nuns are allowed to collect rice directly. The rice is later relinquished to the monastery.</description>

      <description>Sunday night we had an English Dhamma-talk with Sayadaw U Kovida. The new FM Transmitters were used for simultaneous Vietnamese (102 MHz) and Chinese (101MHz) translations. We also used one transmitter for our weekly &amp;ldquo;monks&amp;rsquo; rules&amp;rdquo; class for the Vietnamese group. I&amp;rsquo;m a happy camper! The idea was to have the translators speak quieter so the rest of the group can hear the original English speaker. There is still the noise of two or three translators speaking during the English, but they speak in a normal voice instead of speaking to a crowd of people.</description>

The Thai donors, who are often seen on the daily meal donation board came with a bunch of slippers (flip-flops) and custom made robes from Thailand for Pa-Auk. I would guess that 600 robes were offered last night since they are aware of our numbers.</description>

I remember the American monk who told me about Burma in 1999, when I was just starting my journey, and still in the continental USA.</description>

      <description>I just got 1 otoscope and 4 portable FM transmitters that I requested. Transport, as always, was the most complicated task! These should help make things easier. I love making great ideas come to life, especially my own ideas! (Merit).&#xA;Currently, if we want a doctor to look inside our ears, we need to take a half day trip into Mawlamyine city to see an ear (ENT) specialist. The current volunteer doctors on Wednesdays and Sundays simply use a normal flashlight (UK &amp;ldquo;torch&amp;rdquo;) to look inside the ear.</description>

She was probably on her way to the local market to get some fresh vegetables to add to our lunch that we were in the process of collecting.</description>

      <description>A View Of The Sangha Hospital&#xA;Here are some pictures of the Sangha Hospital Ward on Mawlamyine. The hospital does not smell like a hospital because of the open air design. The last picture is the dining hall.&#xA;Sangha hospital is a free monk ward.﻿&#xA;This was posted on Google+</description>

      <description>A Sidecar Scooter&#xA;Made in Myanmar. I have seen 10 or more school children ride in one of these during my stay in Intakkaw near Yangon. Taxis can often be a 2 wheeled scooter where you and another ride on the back. You will be hard pressed to find the typical Indian Auto rickshaws in Myanmar.&#xA;The picture was taken in front of the Sangha Hospital Ward during an out patient visit to the ENT Doctor.</description>

      <description>What Halloween is like (Alms story inside) Since a good chunk of you are not American, I thought it would be fun to reshare this Halloween picture direct from my hometown in West Hartford, CT. The kids dress up as &amp;hellip;. well anything they want, and then they go house to house and ring the doorbells and say &amp;ldquo;Trick or Treat!&amp;rdquo; After that, the person at the door is somewhat obligated by culture to give small sized candy bars to the kids.</description>

I responded by expressing concerns about the conditions and the Center&amp;rsquo;s status as a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Pa-Auk center. I also have questions about who really &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; and controls the place too. However, progress has been made. Up until recently, Sayadawkyi was unable to invite monks to the place.</description>

      <description>Humpty Dumpty is back together again&#xA;(And it works too). In Myanmar, cars are often recycled many times over due to the high import taxes and the low salaries. Probably less than $150 to do all of that labour. We still have jeeps from 1950 running around with Toyota engine blocks inside.&#xA;﻿&#xA;This was posted on Google+</description>

I originally refused to climb up the Mountain for an interview at the Bodhi Tree. &amp;ldquo;Too much trouble. Get another monk.&amp;rdquo; I said. Then he arranged for an easy location to be interviewed and he even sent a messenger to my kuti to make sure I would come.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Beverly Hills&amp;rdquo; Section of Pa-Auk&#xA;This is my neighborhood. Over the years, the price of wood had skyrocketed, and concrete kuties have become the new standard. However, that does not stop them from laying teak floors inside. I think teak is quite inexpensive in Myanmar compared to the rest of the world. The same could be said about flowers and mangoes, let alone medicine and treatment.&#xA;This neighborhood is quite old now and some other kuti donor/builders have really &amp;ldquo;gone out to town.</description>

      <description>New Pa-Auk Thailand Monastery&#xA;Picture of location in An-ton 2 hours from Bangkok.&#xA;The sima was officially completed (by vinaya transaction) about 6 months ago.&#xA;To complete a legal vinaya transaction, one needs the permission of the residing monks in the village. This could be a problem because monks often do not like newcomers on their own block, especially from Burma. To avoid such technicalities, the Thai donors who arranged this, picked a site in a village with only one monastery, which is abandoned.</description>

      <description>Knowledge of Microphones, Knowledge of Meaning&#xA;The last two patimokkha recitations have been clear sounding without feedback (except when they were playing with the controls). All is due to my recent arrangement for a proper microphone. This makes me very happy and I can rejoice in my efforts when we have our meeting on the new and full moons. I learned about microphones from a monk at my Amaravati visit last year and a professional DJ/ambient music composer who visited Pa-Auk last April.</description>

      <description>Water Cooling Tea&#xA;A common ineffective way to cool tea is to pour the tea back and forth into two cups. A better way is to use the thermal mass of water to cool your tea. By placing it in a bowl of water that is deep enough to submerge 80% of the cup, the tea can be cool very fast. If you stir the tea with a spoon while sliding the cup in a circular motion inside the water, you will add another exponential cooling factor.</description>

However, the local buses in Colombo are rarely rarely government buses.

      <description>Tears Of Joy&#xA;I had arranged for a pedometer for Sayadaw U Revata as an idea to get him to walk more. As Sayadaws become more busy and famous, they get driven in a car to where they need to speak or interview and then they sit and listen to interviews or speak for several hours. After that, they go to the next place in the same fashion. They often have willing assistants to take care of their daily duties so they can spend more time teaching.</description>

      <description>Yogi Gregory (previously Bhikkhu U Dhaminda) recently came to deliver a new Sure sm58 microphone that should not give feedback loops to the PA system during Patimokkha. It was recommended by a famous South African DJ that came here to practice after I pulled him aside to talk shop.&#xA;I arranged this via my supporter who was once a monk with me at both Pa-Auk and Nauyana. Yogi Gregory also delivered some other items as well, driving 6.</description>

      <description>Flowers From Long Ago&#xA;I remember the one time in my lay life when a woman brought me flowers, and for no particular reason either. I had her over my place a few times to play guitar. She was just learning and I thought it would be fun to have her over to play guitar with her. We knew each other from an NGO that did some volunteer work with some kids at a housing project.</description>

      <description>Early Morning Rounds&#xA;A picture of another group of monks going on alms round during my own early morning alms in Intakkaw, Myanmar. November, 2013. One of my many reason for being a monk, besides Nibbana, was not touching money and collecting food with a monk&amp;rsquo;s bowl among other things. Life is good this way.&#xA;I remember telling my grandfather that I wanted to become a monk and beg for food when he was in the hospital fighting cancer.</description>

      <description>The Bhikkhuni Revival According To Orthodox Theravada&#xA;Why Pick-shoo-me? Please see http://subhuti.net.tf/venaggacitta.html&#xA;Here is a document I requested from Venerable Aggacitta of SBS in Malaysia. He wrote this long before things were starting to cook up back in 2004. I remember reading the original article long ago and felt that it addressed the issue of Theravada Bhikkhuni ordinations very well from a Theravada point of view. It is all according to the texts and covers all of the issues of why the Bhikkhuni Sangha is not accepted by most of the Theravada Communities.</description>

No attainments for what I originally came here for, but things are good.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;I told him, &amp;ldquo;You can be happy just radiating Loving-kindness all of the time. It will help with your meditation, but if you do not get any attainments, you still win.</description>

      <description>Cats Like To Eat Corn&#xA;Did you know that cats like corn? Try it, or let them try it. Dogs really like corn too (leave it on the cob). Dogs like just about anything and can survive well on a vegetarian diet of leftover rice and curry.&#xA;The picture is of my neighbour&amp;rsquo;s cat&amp;rsquo;s daughter eating my leftover corn removed from the cob at his kuti.﻿&#xA;This was posted on Google+</description>

      <description>Better Late Than Never&#xA;Some people believe they are too old to become a monk. Venerable Ashin Nandasara ordained at age 55 and has accumulated 30 Rains which is very special among monks who ordain at any age. Currently, he is the oldest bhikkhu practicing today at Pa-Auk Meditation Center (Main) at Aged 85. He is a native of Kawkareik Township and remembers staying with Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadaw during &amp;ldquo;The Early Days&amp;rdquo; when Sayadaw was staying in a bamboo kuti where the 3 story dorm is now.</description>

      <description>Monasterynote5: Walkman Karaoke&#xA;Here is an excerpt from Walkman Karaoke, a story from a collection I wrote from 1999 to 2006 entitled, Going For Broke. Often, these stories would be sent out to family and friends I had long ago whome most were not Buddhists. The stories were just stories and electronic cameras were not common then. In fact, we had a photographer down the street who would come here and take a photo to make our visa or passport photos when we needed one and the color would not be so good because the electricity was never stable for the chemical processing.</description>

      <description>According to the Buddhist texts: After coming back from alms round, we should put the extra food we will not eat aside for the bhikkhus who come later and need it. They too can take from or donate to this bowl. It is quite useful and is used everyday by many monks. It reduces much waste and makes pre-leftovers edible, allowable and shareable.&#xA;Monks cannot eat food that has not been personally offered by a donor.</description>

      <description>Future Posts&#xA;I have been doing quite a bit of 3 finger pecking on my tablet lately. Enough pecking to finally borrow a Pa-Auk communal keyboard from the computer room, but only after completing 67+ pages of abhidhamma lessons! Wow, what a difference that makes. It is almost like having a laptop without the weight and trouble. And when I am done typing, I can give the keyboard back! Ubuntu is also possible due to &amp;ldquo;Complete Linux Installer,&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>The Whispers of Little Wing&#xA;A few days ago, I read in Susan Blackmore&amp;rsquo;s book about how people believe that coincidental happenings are acts of gods, spirits, or even worse, something they themselves made happen. There were experiments cited to debunk this faith which were quite funny and I even repeated this information in reference to how cavemen became spiritual. (Consciousness: A very Short Introduction)&#xA;The next day, I passed by some flowers growing on a bush on my way back to my kuti and thought to myself how wonderful it would be if I asked someone to pluck some flowers so I could have a flower offering to my Buddha in a Sri Lankan Style: on a plate like a Mandala.</description>

Work is optional and may need special permission to do so. 10 Precept Nuns can ordain here as monastics. Nauyana, Sri Lanka has a similar arrangement with Dhammika Ashram. This was only the first or second time that I have been in this hall during a meditation session.&#xA;Pa-Auk Meditation Center, Mawlamyine, Mon State, Myanmar.</description>

      <description>Kitchen for 1,000 to 2,000 Residents Overview&#xA;A layperson and myself took a trip to the lower monastery to take some pictures of the kitchen process.&#xA;I will be sharing several posts from time to time featuring this kitchen experience which was amazing, at least in person.&#xA;The central wood fired oven stove (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right, wood) is seen in this picture. Another stove on the side was in operation too.</description>

      <description>Sayadawgyi finished his six day Dhamma Talk series in Myanmar Language on The Brahmanimantanika Sutta. His first words were about America and the wrong views about Buddhism there. He shouted his lion&amp;rsquo;s roar and several thousand devotees came to see him. Venerable U Dhammasena was recruited to continue the translation. It was amazing how he was able to translate Sayadaw&amp;rsquo;s bullet train Dhamma talk style in realtime. It was stressful but he was grateful for the opportunity.</description>

      <description>Here is a picture of the translation of Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadaw&amp;rsquo;s Dhamma talk with the fm mic. We used the mic from Thailand with a 100 ft range. Just anybody in the hall could passively tune in with their telephone or mp3 player&amp;rsquo;s FM radio component. 90.9 MHz. There is was virtually no disturbance or awareness of this project going on inside the hall.&#xA;Sadhu to Donors for helping me realize this concept started 8 or so months ago.</description>

      <description>Here is a picture of a temporary novice monk (Samanera) from Scotland at our roadside Bodhi Tree. Pa-Auk is one of the few places in the world that follows the vinaya (code of rules) that will ordain foreigners for a short period of time without any commitment. It is part of the Myanmar Monastic Culture. When local people come for a retreat, quite often, they ordain as full monks (Bhikkhus) for that time.</description>

The side panel of our monk bags are usually double layer and are sewed in a way that a simple cut and hem will create a nifty water bottle compartment. It took me 13 years to learn this one!

      <description>Repost of one single vid small size. 13mb&#xA;The new Meditation Hall for Lay Yogis in The Middle Monastery of Pa-Auk Forest Monastery.&#xA;Work days are rare and voluntary at Pa-Auk, so lots of preparation is done to make it worth everyone&amp;rsquo;s time. About 500-600 people showed up by my estimates.&#xA;4 mixing stations constantly going to feed the fire line, Gloves to protect the hands, a crew to wash the gloves, a crew for drinks, a crew to deliver drinks, a crew to carry sand and rocks and cement to the mixing stations, a crew to give the rocks and sand, etc to the mixing stations, a slide and crew to return the empty buckets, and of course a huge fire line of monks, nuns and laypeople to bring the cement to the second floor.</description>

      <description>3 pics on transportation in Myanmar.&#xA;1. The taxes on cars are less expensive than before, but still expensive. For example, a used (legal) Toyota Land Cruiser may have cost $200,000 USD in 2001. To get around this, it is now very common to buy a tractor engine and make a truck out of it. They are used for hauling just about anything, including school children.&#xA;Myanmar was once known as a place where you could still see ox and pony carts, but they are quickly becoming a thing of the past.</description>

      <description>Today, February 7th, is my ordination anniversary from 2001. I ordained under Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadaw on the February full moon day for the purpose of liberation. I can still remember burning my credit and bank cards the day before hoping to never to touch money ever again. I was so scared, but I knew it was the right path for me. So far, so good.&#xA;In 1999, I left home to travel the world and possibly following my dream of becoming a monk, and that is exactly what I did.</description>

      <description>Here is a picture of my old kuti (#123) from 2001 to 2005. At that time nearly all kuties were what we now call &amp;ldquo;Black Kuties.&amp;rdquo; They are black because they were painted every so often with a new coat of used engine oil to keep the bugs out and to &amp;ldquo;finish&amp;rdquo; the wood at the same time. Sayadaw U Punnyananda was living there before I moved in. He must have been two vassa then.</description>

      <description>In the early days of Pa-Auk, Sayalay Daw Ma (Shan) Canda used to give fruti to some of the regular monks when it was difficult to come by without private supporters. Nearly every day, she was seen helping out in the almsfood line. She had medical problems, but it was difficult to know by her cheerful attitude and success in meditation. She died about a year ago. The packets still continue and eventually the name on the packages changed to the living Sayalay Yathawati (Rasavati) who manages the dana in her memory.</description>

      <description>OK, This was the first question for English competency. Try to figure out what to write!&#xA;Yes, you bet I asked and so did a lot of others. I should pass both the English and Buddhism sections. About 4 hours of continuous writing in two sessions. This year they did not ask any questions with technical grammer labels from my 6th grade english books I am no longer familiar with. Tomorrow is the oral exam, though we have not been told when or where!</description>

      <description>This was from Pa Auk Mawlamyine befire I left for Intakaw. With over 500 monks, a fully operational clinic is possible. Western Medicine Doctors come twice per week. A Dental Surgeon two or three times per week. And of course, Local Myanmar Medicine one day per week. Most medicine is usually donated an available &amp;ldquo;in-house.&amp;rdquo; Malaria testing is available &amp;ldquo;in-house&amp;rdquo; too. Much has changed since 2001!

      <description>This non-legged creature was found in my kuti. The picture was shot from my bed about 6 feet away. As you can see, he came from the widely spaced floorboards. Sorry about the photo quality, I might have been shaking. One time when I described a craite snake (found inches from my bed) to Venerable Pa Auk Sayadaw, he said to me, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry. It&amp;rsquo;s not dangerous but VERY poisonous.&amp;rdquo; He meant it won&amp;rsquo;t chase you.</description>

      <description>For those of you who do not know what an Asian shower room looks like! This one is luxurious with a stainless steel water bowl! Ahhh! I often prefer this method over a shower head (This shower room does not have one, but if it did I would still prefer this method). A long time ago, Westerners did this too. The toilet is inside the same room too, not shown.</description>

      <description>Tea is considered a medicine in most Theravada traditions and allowable after NOON. At Pa Auk, we are NOT allowed tea after NOON because &amp;ldquo;medicines&amp;rdquo; should be for medical purposes. Green tea is often pickled and served with meals, called lapet. In contrast, fresh juice drinks are allowable after NOON for a single evening in all Theravada traditions. Yesterday was fresh squeezed (and chilled) sugar cane juice. &amp;ldquo;If god gives you lemons, make lemonade.</description>
