There is a very small rule about having the robes fully covered when we are in a populated areas (sekhiyā 3). Although it is a very small rule, it can say a great deal about the monk and his respect for the monastic code, especially in the afternoons or evenings.

<p><strong>Why do monks have one shoulder exposed sometimes and both shoulders covered other times?</strong><br>
There is a very small rule about having the robes fully covered when we are in a populated areas (sekhiyā 3). Although it is a very small rule, it can say a great deal about the monk and his respect for the monastic code, especially in the afternoons or evenings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Populated areas&rdquo; refers to when we are outside of the monastery and outside of the forest. Buddhist Shrines in a city like Shwedagon Pagoda can be considered a &ldquo;monastery&rdquo; and it is OK and sometimes culturally proper to go bare shouldered inside. However, some may choose to stay to be fully covered if there are many women around.</p>
<p>Monks often leave the monastery for collecting alms food. Because of that, whether one cares about the rules or not, it has become a tradition that is followed when one collects food more or less to show that &ldquo;one is collecting food.&rdquo; At Pa-Auk, we go fully clothed at the alms food hall which is <em>inside</em> the monastery for the purpose of tradition. The alms-giving section where the women are allowed, is treated like an &ldquo;outside and populated&rdquo; place even though it is not required by the rules.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ajahnandmeelgin-1024x768.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Contrary, if a monk is living in a dwelling place, even with a temporary determination as a residence for himself, he may make himself comfortable inside and switch to one shoulder. However, if it is a typical hotel, apartment building, or residential house, with women anywhere inside the building, the monk should not lie down at night in such a place according to a different rule (pācittiyā). For instance, in 2007, when Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadaw traveled to the India Holy Sites, he slept in a camper van to avoid all problems at hotels.<br>
(most monasteries/temples in the world, likewise in India, are unallowable because they handle money, etc (nissaggiyā pācittiyā 10,18,19,20) ).</p>
<p>For monks that follow the rules strictly, if you see one on the streets, <strong>he will be fully covered during any time of the day</strong>. If he is travelling, seeing a doctor or even riding in a car from one location to the next, even inside the same village, he will take the time to wrap himself completely.</p>
<p>Just as a child who shows respect to his parents by following <em>all</em> of their rules, monks should reflect in the same way about The Buddha.</p>
