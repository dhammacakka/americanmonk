I found what seems to be a perpetual flower source and have been doing chanting on a regular basis. I have been inviting other monks to join me in my kuti and it now looks as though I may have two regulars.
One of the faults of Pa-Auk or Myanmar in general, according to most foreigners, is the chanting style. This is because they have a pronunciation scheme that is different from all other countries.

          Tears Of Joy
I had arranged for a pedometer for Sayadaw U Revata as an idea to get him to walk more. As Sayadaws become more busy and famous, they get driven in a car to where they need to speak or interview and then they sit and listen to interviews or speak for several hours. After that, they go to the next place in the same fashion. They often have willing assistants to take care of their daily duties so they can spend more time teaching.

          Yogi Gregory (previously Bhikkhu U Dhaminda) recently came to deliver a new Sure sm58 microphone that should not give feedback loops to the PA system during Patimokkha. It was recommended by a famous South African DJ that came here to practice after I pulled him aside to talk shop.
I arranged this via my supporter who was once a monk with me at both Pa-Auk and Nauyana. Yogi Gregory also delivered some other items as well, driving 6.

I remember the one time in my lay life when a woman brought me flowers, and for no particular reason either. I had her over my place a few times to play guitar. She was just learning and I thought it would be fun to have her over to play guitar with her. We knew each other from an NGO that did some volunteer work with some kids at a housing project.

A picture of another group of monks going on alms round during my own early morning alms in Intakkaw, Myanmar. November, 2013. One of my many reason for being a monk, besides Nibbana, was not touching money and collecting food with a monk&rsquo;s bowl among other things. Life is good this way.
I remember telling my grandfather that I wanted to become a monk and beg for food when he was in the hospital fighting cancer.

          The Bhikkhuni Revival According To Orthodox Theravada
Why Pick-shoo-me? Please see http://subhuti.net.tf/venaggacitta.html
Here is a document I requested from Venerable Aggacitta of SBS in Malaysia. He wrote this long before things were starting to cook up back in 2004. I remember reading the original article long ago and felt that it addressed the issue of Theravada Bhikkhuni ordinations very well from a Theravada point of view. It is all according to the texts and covers all of the issues of why the Bhikkhuni Sangha is not accepted by most of the Theravada Communities.

Did you know that cats like corn? Try it, or let them try it. Dogs really like corn too (leave it on the cob). Dogs like just about anything and can survive well on a vegetarian diet of leftover rice and curry.
The picture is of my neighbour&rsquo;s cat&rsquo;s daughter eating my leftover corn removed from the cob at his kuti.﻿

Some people believe they are too old to become a monk. Venerable Ashin Nandasara ordained at age 55 and has accumulated 30 Rains which is very special among monks who ordain at any age. Currently, he is the oldest bhikkhu practicing today at Pa-Auk Meditation Center (Main) at Aged 85. He is a native of Kawkareik Township and remembers staying with Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadaw during &ldquo;The Early Days&rdquo; when Sayadaw was staying in a bamboo kuti where the 3 story dorm is now.

This scene is easily recognizable to be the area close to the Upper Meditation Hall, located halfway up the mountain. Long ago, I camped out inside that hall for about two years with the &ldquo;overflow bhikhus,&rdquo; but that is another story.

          Monasterynote5: Walkman Karaoke
Here is an excerpt from Walkman Karaoke, a story from a collection I wrote from 1999 to 2006 entitled, Going For Broke. Often, these stories would be sent out to family and friends I had long ago whome most were not Buddhists. The stories were just stories and electronic cameras were not common then. In fact, we had a photographer down the street who would come here and take a photo to make our visa or passport photos when we needed one and the color would not be so good because the electricity was never stable for the chemical processing.

          According to the Buddhist texts: After coming back from alms round, we should put the extra food we will not eat aside for the bhikkhus who come later and need it. They too can take from or donate to this bowl. It is quite useful and is used everyday by many monks. It reduces much waste and makes pre-leftovers edible, allowable and shareable.
Monks cannot eat food that has not been personally offered by a donor.

I have been doing quite a bit of 3 finger pecking on my tablet lately. Enough pecking to finally borrow a Pa-Auk communal keyboard from the computer room, but only after completing 67+ pages of abhidhamma lessons! Wow, what a difference that makes. It is almost like having a laptop without the weight and trouble. And when I am done typing, I can give the keyboard back! Ubuntu is also possible due to &ldquo;Complete Linux Installer,&rdquo;

          The Whispers of Little Wing
A few days ago, I read in Susan Blackmore&rsquo;s book about how people believe that coincidental happenings are acts of gods, spirits, or even worse, something they themselves made happen. There were experiments cited to debunk this faith which were quite funny and I even repeated this information in reference to how cavemen became spiritual. (Consciousness: A very Short Introduction)
The next day, I passed by some flowers growing on a bush on my way back to my kuti and thought to myself how wonderful it would be if I asked someone to pluck some flowers so I could have a flower offering to my Buddha in a Sri Lankan Style: on a plate like a Mandala.

Work is optional and may need special permission to do so. 10 Precept Nuns can ordain here as monastics. Nauyana, Sri Lanka has a similar arrangement with Dhammika Ashram.

A layperson and myself took a trip to the lower monastery to take some pictures of the kitchen process.
I will be sharing several posts from time to time featuring this kitchen experience which was amazing, at least in person.
The central wood fired oven stove (yes, that&rsquo;s right, wood) is seen in this picture. Another stove on the side was in operation too.

The first Abhidhamma Post has been shared to several groups except Buddhism and Meditation and it was tiring to do.
The second Abhidhamma post on the singular mind with an example on mercy killing has not been shared to any Buddhist and Spiritual communities to date.

          Sayadawgyi finished his six day Dhamma Talk series in Myanmar Language on The Brahmanimantanika Sutta. His first words were about America and the wrong views about Buddhism there. He shouted his lion&rsquo;s roar and several thousand devotees came to see him. Venerable U Dhammasena was recruited to continue the translation. It was amazing how he was able to translate Sayadaw&rsquo;s bullet train Dhamma talk style in realtime. It was stressful but he was grateful for the opportunity.

Pa-Auk is one of the few places in the world that follows the vinaya (code of rules) that will ordain foreigners for a short period of time without any commitment. It is part of the Myanmar Monastic Culture. When local people come for a retreat, quite often, they ordain as full monks (Bhikkhus) for that time.

The patimokkha is roughly a 45 page book of 227 rules that the monks must follow. They are chanted (by memory) by one skilled in memory.
