Thumbs Up For Hitchhiking
Thumbs Up For Hitchhiking I remember when I was fourteen or so, some time in the mid eighties, when I started to test the realm beyond my parents&rsquo; advice.

          Text posted by imron yousuf. At https://plus.google.com/117415869687509148486 &ldquo;Very little has been said about this…..On December 2, Basque athlete Iván Fernández Anaya was competing in a cross-country race in Burlada, Navarre. He was running second, some distance behind race leader Abel Mutai - bronze medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the London Olympics. As they entered the finishing straight, he saw the Kenyan runner - the certain winner of the race - mistakenly pull up about 10 meters before the finish, thinking he had already crossed the line.

My dream to be a monk and live in Hawaii, which specifically changed to Kauai, that started in 1999 might come true. I got the green light for air tickets and other things. I just need to get the visa for my Sri Lankan monastic friend who agreed to come. If this visa gets approved, I will be even more happy!

They might be Giants
During this time, called, &ldquo;The Water Festival&rdquo; many &ldquo;young and old&rdquo; take robes temporarily. It is the &ldquo;summer&rdquo; equivalent like we have in the West. No School.
Recently, a foreigner friend disrobed a few days ago. I think he was on his second or third year. He was the ideal monk, quite passive, talks only when you need him to, quiet most of the time and fairly progressed in meditation too (with pa-auk standards).

          Before and After Water Filter
I have been using this water filter for about a month or so now. It is working well and I have not had brown water days yet! I was going to leave because of the water and my ear problems which has now turned into Tinnitus. That is not fun when you meditate as your main gig. I asked a friend of mine, U Jotika who had offered a filter for me long ago when he showed me around his new kuti which also had a filter.

          The Old Fashion Fire-Line Method
Without a concrete truck, you need many volunteers to work in a concrete fire-line to pour concrete. Bucket by bucket, the task gets completed. I have never seen or heard of any other method used for any of the buildings at Pa-auk. This project is for Sayadawkyi&rsquo;s new meeting room which will be attached to his newest kuti at Pa-Auk Tawya. His first kuti, made from bamboo has been torn down and replaced with a new three story 80 room dormitory.

Next to relationships and my guitar, or maybe ahead of them, Kauai is my lost love in life and I can touch it too!

A 2015 retreat is rumoured to happen in Maymyo, Pa-Auk Branch with Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadawkyi.
There are 3 Pa-auk Maymyo monasteries right next to each other.
1.). Old section
2.). Middle section
3.). Newest section (completely separated and independent from the other two sections)
Supposedly, only the newest branch will be used for the 2015 retreat and the other two will not be used.

          From my oldest posts from GPlus in 2015, which are slowly being restored.
A Counterfeit Mitsubishi Truck was found in Pa-Auk Forest Monastery. I had my doubts, so I asked the driver to open up the hood. It was in fact, a Toyota engine block. Consumers, please be careful!
In the olden days there were very high taxes on cars. I think 200% tax which made used cars hold their value well.

Lending A Hand | With Metta
A car in the snow. By Adam Glick. This winter Boston set a record for snow and cold. We had nearly 5 feet of snow in 3 weeks and the temperatures were frequently below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. We live in the residential part of the city, so parking is typically a challenge.

          That Little Itch Might Be Telling You Something
A famous tagline when I grew up for the famous dandruff shampoo which can actually be a fungus. (The active ingredients of such shampoos are often antifungal)
Albendazole is another remedy for itchiness at the other end of the body, usually at night, commonly called worms. The itchiness comes from the female worms who wriggle their way outside to lay their eggs.????

Sharing and Caring. | With Metta
December 26, 2014. I want to share something that happened to me here this morning. I went to the dining hall as usual for breakfast. Lots of people today for tambun ( donating to the Sangha). I walked the lines of lay supporters getting rice and then got the rest of my food.

          Razors and Switchblades
These are the types of razors that most monks use in Myanmar. I used one of these for about eight years with one of the sides modified so it did not having the safety bar. We called the sides; &ldquo;safety side&rdquo; and &ldquo;dangerous side.&rdquo; With the dangerous side, one can wait a week or even 4 weeks before shaving. The safety bar is what causes the blade to clog and the &ldquo;dangerous side&rdquo; removes &ldquo;clogging&rdquo; from the formula.

          Dinner For One
A simple story where a donation to a beggar on a New York City subway turned into a lasting memory that touched his heart. While not all donations turn into lasting memories, some do. It may not be immediately easy to see why it was important, yet we all have a story where it means more to you than others, for reasons of personal interpretation and circumstance. This story reflects on the joy of giving, encourages giving, and the idea of relinquishment.

The Ashoka pillar has become the Pa-Auk logo over time and it was originally initiated by U Dhamminda for one of Sayadawkyi&rsquo;s books when he was a monk in the 90&rsquo;s. The pillar at Pa-Auk was originally a white plaster color, but that has been changed by an artist monk.
During a time near 2003 or 2004, I remember a French/Armenian Ven. Jaruvanna, who used to be an artist, decided to repair one of the lions which had a broken jaw.

          Donation Day today at Pa-Auk.
This is a time where all of the teachers come together from the 29 local Myanmar monasteries. There are 11monasteries abroad if you want to count the USA branch.
This is also a time when large or huge amounts of donations are made. We filled 2.5 rice sacks with goods today! While most of it was superfluous goods, like washing powder, soap and notebooks, there are some special things as well.

          There are rumors that Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadawkyi will be coming to Pa-Auk Tawya main for the famous February meeting of teachers. Venerable Sayadawkyi is still in Vietnam and will continue to be in Vietnam until the Doctors say it is OK to leave.
This information was confirmed today by Venerable Kumei Sayadaw, U Cando, and U Kumudha, directly to me.
This picture is from 2004 and seems to be the Buddha that is housed in MettaVihari Female meditation Hall Pa-Auk Main, Mawlamyine, Mon State, Myanmar.

          A Monk Working In The Umbrella Repair Shop
Kuti #1, The Kuti Village
Pa-Auk Forest Monastery Main, Mawlamyine, Mon State Myanmar
Quote from &ldquo;Going For Broke&rdquo;. (Different monk in picture. Almost all reconditioned umbrellas are double deckers)
From 2004
Umbrellas surely break, and we now have an umbrella repair service station at kuti #1. I call the monk in charge of this “U THEE,” which means “Venerable Umbrella.” You can actually use “I’m sorry I was late, my umbrella was in the shop” as an excuse in this monastery.

The monk on the left was reciting while his friend checked to see if he was correct. Here, he made a mistake and his friend is pointing it out to him. Not only can the young monks read and memorize, but they do it at the same speed as the guy who reads the fine print at the end of a car lease commercial. Of course, in a third language.

          I can claim personally that meditation improved my academics. I did very poorly in school and SAT. However, after I meditated regularly, I graduated university with a 3.54 cumulative GPA at my university. I believe it helped me in the computer field as well.
Of course, meditation changed my entire life altogether:-) ﻿
Meditation transforms roughest San Francisco schools
At first glance, Quiet Time - a stress reduction strategy used in several San Francisco middle and high schools, as well as in scattered schools around the Bay Area - looks like something out of the om-chanting 1960s.

          I too had this problem when I flew to the USA on British Airways in 2008, but I have never delayed a plane for this problem. Actually, it was my monastic friend who was travelling with me who was put next to a woman. Unfortunately, although I made sure a note about seating was inside our reservations, the reservation notes do not get sent up to the plane. I am not sure why special reservation instructions do not get sent to the plane, but that is the policy, and take heed if you are a monk or you send your kid on a plane with fatal food allergies.

          I am staying a Varanasi Monastery. It is a monastery that follows the rules closely. There are many adorable little monks here, about 25. There are about 15 adult monks too. This place is a Nepalese monastery with Nepalese immigrants. Some are several generations, but they have still retained their language. Teaching is done in Myanmar language. There are approximately 300,000 Nepalese people living in Myanmar today.
The first photo is the planned monastery.

          A classic picture of the Pa-Auk novice monks from 2004. The young (and adorable) monks were moved to a center in Mahemyine. It is certainly one of my all time favorite top ten pictures from Pa-Auk.
I am currently staying in Yangon at Varanasi learning monastery. There are many young samaneras here. I should snap some pictures before I leave.

It is always nice to see something that I arranged being used in the clinic as standard equipment.
I am sure the donor of the clinic itself feels a hundred times better.
Btw: An otoscope is the standard device doctors use to look inside your ears. I have never seen a general practitioner anywhere in Sri Lanka or Myanmar have one of these on his/her desk.

A friend came here with this video predownloaded (as most downloads in Myanmar, with our connection speeds). It is absolutely one of the best videos on Myanmar, but only three minutes and forty-five seconds long :(
It is amazing what people can do these days and it feels so 3D too.
