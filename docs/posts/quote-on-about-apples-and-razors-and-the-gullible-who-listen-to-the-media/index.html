I remember my time as a youth inspecting and eating candy as though it were like I was eating fish with hidden bones.</p>
<p>Wikipedia on &ldquo;Halloween&rdquo; subtopic &ldquo;Foods&rdquo; (2012 edition)<br>
&hellip;<br>
At one time, candy apples were commonly given to children, but the practice rapidly waned in the wake of widespread rumors that some individuals were embedding items like pins and razor blades in the apples.[50] While there is evidence of such incidents,[51] they are quite rare and have never resulted in serious injury. Nonetheless, many parents assumed that such heinous practices were rampant because of the mass media. At the peak of the hysteria, some hospitals offered free X-rays of children&rsquo;s Halloween hauls in order to find evidence of tampering. Virtually all of the few known candy poisoning incidents involved parents who poisoned their own children&rsquo;s candy.[52]﻿</p>
