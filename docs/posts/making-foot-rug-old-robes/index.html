    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Here is an instructional video on how to make a foot-rug from old and discarded monk&rsquo;s robes.  If you are a monk, perhaps you will be very interested in this.  I made the video as I was making my very first rug.  Ven. Khemavamsa is the one who helped in the end.  It was his idea and I have never seen this before.  The story from the texts is below:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/56ZgPffPJgY">https://youtu.be/56ZgPffPJgY</a></p>
<p>Ven. Ānanda told King Udena what the sangha did with their robes.</p>
<p>King Udena spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “Did not our concubines come here, good 1 Ānanda?” “Your concubines did come here, your majesty.” “Did they not give anything to the honourable 2 Ānanda?” “They gave me five hundred inner robes, your majesty.” “But what can you, honourable 3 Ānanda, do with so many robes?” “I will share them, your majesty, with those monks whose robes are worn thin.” “But what will you do, good Ānanda, with those old robes that are worn thin?” “We will make them into upper coverings, 4 your majesty.” “But what will you do, good Ānanda, with those upper coverings that are old?” “We will make these into mattress coverings, your majesty.” “But what will you do, good Ānanda, with those mattress coverings that are old?” “We will make them into ground coverings, your majesty.” “But what will you do, good Ānanda, with those ground coverings that are old?” “We will make them into foot-wipers, your majesty.” “But what will you do, good Ānanda, with those <strong>foot-wipers</strong> that are old?” “We will make them into dusters, your majesty.” “But what will you do, good Ānanda, with those dusters that are old?” “Having torn them into shreds, your majesty, having kneaded them with mud, we will smear a plaster-flooring.” Then King Udena, thinking: [291] ‘These recluses, sons of the Sakyans, use everything in an orderly way and do not let things go to waste,’ 5 bestowed even another five hundred woven cloths on the venerable Ānanda. Therefore this was the first time that a thousand robes had accrued to the venerable Ānanda as an alms of robes. ||</p>
