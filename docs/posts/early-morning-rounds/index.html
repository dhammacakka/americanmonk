A picture of another group of monks going on alms round during my own early morning alms in Intakkaw, Myanmar. November, 2013. One of my many reason for being a monk, besides Nibbana, was not touching money and collecting food with a monk&rsquo;s bowl among other things. Life is good this way.</p>
<p>I remember telling my grandfather that I wanted to become a monk and beg for food when he was in the hospital fighting cancer. While I should have used a different expression for &ldquo;begging,&rdquo; that was how it came out and he was not so happy to hear that. (And talk about bad timing&hellip;.) Nevertheless, he was happy to know I would travel the globe. He recovered before I left home, but had a relapse later on. I am sure he enjoyed my stories from Kauai, Hawaii and I was only five months into my trip which did not have an end or destination in mind.</p>
<p>When he first learned about my travel plans, he told me a story about a man he spoke to long ago on his docked boat who was sailing around the world. He said to him, &ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;ve got a lot of balls to do this.&rdquo;. The man replied, &ldquo;You know, I would have a lot of balls <em>not</em> to do this.&rdquo;<br>
The final words from &ldquo;Father and Son,&rdquo; a song always dear to my heart comes to mind.<br>
&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ve got to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During my travels, I was being evacuated from Fiji during the uprising of 2000 because the place I was staying at got torched with a fire bomb. When I called my folks to let them know I was OK, my uncle answered my mother&rsquo;s cell phone at the hospital, which was strange. I found out my grandfather had relapsed and he did not want me to know so that I would continue with my journey. Everyone was there saying their last goodbyes and I was sort of connected there too. He died the next day, but part of his personality survives in me today.</p>
