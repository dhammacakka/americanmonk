He is now a sāmaṇera (novice monk) and not yet a fully ordained bhikkhu. I thought that it would be interesting to show his path to monkhood to you.</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-regular-person">Stage 1: Regular Person</h2>
<p>First he was a regular lay person working as a construction assistant engineer in the Maldives and then made the transition to a devoted layperson. Here you can see he is more serious about Buddhism and cleaning an ancient Buddhist shrine.</p>

<h2 id="stage-2-upāsako">Stage 2: Upāsako</h2>
<p>After getting more into Buddhism and wanting to make the transition to a full time yogi, he came to the monastery and started wearing white clothes. He is called an upāsako. Such factors of an upāsako are listed below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>        ▪ definitions for upāsaka,
            • Upāsaka→takes refuge in Buddha Dhamma Saṅgha is enough to call him an upāsaka. 
            • He is associated with the Triple Gem.
            • 8 qualities given in sutta p49
                ◦ does the upāsaka have faith in sāsana and also establishes other s in the benefit of faith
                    ▪ take care of self and also others
                ◦ He has sīla and establishes other in sīla
                ◦ He is generous
                ◦ He is pleased to see bhikkhus
                ◦ He is pleased to hear dhamma
                ◦ He is absorbed the dhamma and help others 
                ◦ He practices dhamma
        ▪ Who is upāsaka (ko upāsako)
            • if someone go for refuge in Buddha Dhamma sangha, he is called &#34;bho upāsaka&#34;
                ◦ He should have 5 precepts
                    ▪ sometimes 8 9 10 precepts
                ◦ has right livelihood

<h2 id="stage-3-paṇḍupalāsa-old-leaf-ready-to-fall">Stage 3: Paṇḍupalāsa (old leaf ready to fall)</h2>
<p>Chathuranga came to the monastery on November 10th, 2022 and he went to the 2nd stage called paṇḍupalāsa on near the first of June, 2023. He spent 2 weeks wearing red clothes which were given to him by the chief monk. This is to represent a leaf that gets old and falls from a tree. In the next stage you can see him in red clothes, but not yet a monk. However, he has 10 precepts similar to a novice monk.</p>

<h2 id="stage-4-taking-sāmaṇera-robes">Stage 4: Taking Sāmaṇera Robes</h2>
<p>Lastly, after two weeks in red, he can finally enter the novice monk stage. His name is Reverend Paññāsekara.</p>

<p>Here he is sāmaṇera Paññāsekara</p>
<p><img src="/images/Pannyasekara-sit-1-1024x576.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On June 18th, 2023, Chathuranga became a sāmaṇera. Next year, again on June 18th, 2024, he will become a fully ordained bhikkhu. All monks from this tradition take the full bhikkhu ordination during the 3 day ordination period starting on June 18th annually. I&rsquo;ll probably update this post and send this post again to the subscribers. However, he will look pretty much the same. He follows the ten precepts. I have an article which explains the 5, 8 and 10 precepts. I hope you can read it below as well. Be sure to subscribe to get the latest post notifications delivered to your email. I hope you enjoyed this and may you one day become a monk as well.</p>

<h3 id="5-8-and-10-precepts">5, 8 and 10 Precepts</h3>
<p>Here is a comparison of 5, 8 and 10 precepts.  The Buddhist who follows five precepts is known as a regular lay Buddhist.  The person who follows 8 precepts is known as a serious Buddhist yogi.   The person who follows the 10 precepts is known as a novice monk.  A bhikkhu follows 227 rules. …</p>
