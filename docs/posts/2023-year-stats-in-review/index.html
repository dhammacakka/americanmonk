<p>This year, my AmericanMonk.org website was 504 short of 60,000 filtered views (that removes bots and other stuff). The number of users who visited was up to 36,000. Not so bad and better than the year before. The progress over the years is evident in the yearly chart. Simply by writing down things that inspire me, people became interested. Google seems to like my website and recommends my posts on a variety of specialized topics taking a majority of 29,000 search engine referrals from this year alone. My parents read most of my articles and it is a good chance for me to give them some of the teachings.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Anandajoti Bhikkhu who created my first website to host an Abhidhamma book I made with a &ldquo;TF&rdquo; extension and then he hosted my first wordpress website along with his server. After going to Hawai&rsquo;i, I renamed my website to something more easily recognizable by non-buddhists. I often got blanks stares when I said my website was subhuti-dot-withmetta-dot-net . When I sent my request to my URL donor, it was originally requested for &ldquo;usamonk&rdquo;. He wrote me back and said, &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; USA as a name did not (and still does not) have a positive world reputation in the eyes of the world. I settled on AmericanMonk which is a little more subtle. If you do not get the posts because of the facebook algo, there are email subs available on my website. Currently about 600 emails go out for each post.</p>
