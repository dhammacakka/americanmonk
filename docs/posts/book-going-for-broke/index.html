<p><em>Going For Broke: Travelogs On Becoming a Buddhist Monk</em> is a compilation of travel stories.  It is an anonymously written book about a lay person who quit his job in order to travel the world and then become a Buddhist Monk.  Most people either love it and read it in a few days or never finish it.</p>
<p>Here is the back cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Going for Broke&rdquo; consists of travel stories written by a young American man who gave up his lucrative job to travel the world and decide if he would fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a Buddhist monk. As he traveled, he sent accounts of his adventures as a backpacker in Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, India, and Nepal and then about his life as monk in Thailand and Myanmar&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At age 28, when an ethical problem arose at work, the author gave up his lucrative computer career to travel the world and decide whether to renounce it and become a Buddhist monk as he long dreamed. &ldquo;Going for Broke&rdquo; consists of travel stories and reflections sent to a growing list of friends as he traveled to Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, India, Nepal, Thailand and Myanmar. In a magical moment on the shore of an island, he makes a discovery that convinces him of his destiny. He goes on to ordain as a Theravada monk, gambling the stable life he had for enlightenment&ndash; literally &ldquo;Going for Broke.&rdquo; The book describes in detail his life as a monk, thoughts on meditation, and a return trip to visit his family in the United States for the first time wearing his monk&rsquo;s robes.&rdquo;</p>
