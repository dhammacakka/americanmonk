      <description>Last week I taught Fingernail Meditation. This is where one uses the fingernail(s) as a subject of meditation. Although this has probably never been taught before by anyone as a standalone meditation subject, it is a subsection of a meditation instruction that all monks are given on their ordination day. That is called, &amp;ldquo;The First Five Body Parts,&amp;rdquo; Yes, it is that well known, but rarely ever or even never taught.</description>
