      <description>I had a really good day going for alms today. When it “rains it pours.” Although it rained today, I am talking about alms donations. I told myself, that if this village does not give (like usual), then I will skip it and find another one or stay with the shack village alone. After 3 weeks of only one donor in that village, I finally got some edible food&amp;hellip;. However, I accomplished that by going down some other side-roads I had started to skip.</description>

      <title>The Benefits of Faith Alms</title>

      <description>The benefits of “Faith piṇḍapata”. This is a term that I learned either in Abhayagiri, Ca, or Wat Pah Nanachat or both. Probably brought to the West from Ajahn Pasanno who is/was the abbot of both. This means that when you go on alms, you make a determination to only eat the alms food you collect. When you do something like this (and I am not sooo perfect when I follow these things), you can learn a lot about yourself and the real Buddhist teachings.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_793&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;1200&amp;rdquo;] Top: Ma Ba Tha conference Bottom: Reaching out to Muslims to show loving-kindness[/caption]&#xA;Recently, I was convinced to go to a “seminar on peace” this past Saturday. Some of you may have seen my picture on Facebook in regards to a Ma Ba Tha conference I attended. I was told that I should not pay attention to the negative press and that they are a peaceful organization and the gathering was about peace.</description>
