      <description>My near-empty tube of Meswak next to the new one&#xA;At Pa-Auk, we get different items throughout the year. Sometimes we keep them, and sometimes we give them away. I usually give my extra items away quickly so I don&amp;rsquo;t end up with a private Walmart inside my kuti. However, I do plan ahead sometimes.&#xA;I prefer using strong fluoride toothpaste after lunch and then using a natural toothpaste in the evening after our 5 pm juice offering.</description>
