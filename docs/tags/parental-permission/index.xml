      <description>Here is a post with a video link on how I got permission from my parents. In early 2001, when I was in Myanmar, and traveling for 1.5 years, I called my parents and asked them for permission to ordain as a monk. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get permission at first and then I told them I would never see them again if I didn&amp;rsquo;t get permission.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;If I am hurt alive or dead, you will never see me ever again.</description>
