      <description>The Pali Text Society has made its Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidhamma books available for non-commercial use since 2013. The Sutta books have been extracted from the Buddhadust Website which is still considered as &amp;ldquo;work in progress.&amp;rdquo; However, the work was good enough to reformat as eBooks in its current state.&#xA;Stephen Torrence and myself did most of the work to reformat the web pages into eBook versions. There were thousands of webpages which required many scripts to remove the web content.</description>
