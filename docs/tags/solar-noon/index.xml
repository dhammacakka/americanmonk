      <description>Recently I made a mobile app to help me know when the Solar Noon is approaching and past.&#xA;Why Is the Sun Important for Bhikkhus? Why Is The Sun Important for 8 &amp;amp; 10 Precepts? If you are a monk, nun or a practicing yogi who has vowed to not eat after Noon, you will benefit from this app. The real Solar Noon is not 12:00 pm when it comes to the Buddhist rules because there were no clocks back then.</description>
