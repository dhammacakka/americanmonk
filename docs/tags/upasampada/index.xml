      <description>cc0 picture https://pxhere.com/en/photo/489726&#xA;There is not much written in English explaining why bhikkhuni ordinations are rejected by the Theravāda Community of Monks. The English writings are a poor representation of the vast majority of Buddhist Scholarship and that is why there is &amp;ldquo;controversy&amp;rdquo; regarding the revival of the extinct Theravāda Bhikkhuni order. There is really no controversy to speak about once you know the full story.&#xA;Many Westerners believe that women are not able to become nuns without such a revival, but that is not true.</description>
