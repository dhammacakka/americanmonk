      <description>Ven Sunanda (China)&#xA;One of the Chinese monks named Venerable Sunanda recently had his birthday. For his birthday, he determined to offer 100 shoulder cloths to various monks and ended up making 123. What is a shoulder cloth? It is a small robe that monks often like to wear underneath their upper robe.&#xA;from http://www.justwalkedby.com/2016/03/sweeping-monk/ creative commons attrib nc&#xA;We have an abundance of robes in the storage room and with vassa coming up, we will get more and more.</description>

      <description>This is where I live&#xA;Wow! Today is February 7th and another year has passed. I have now completed 18 years total as a monk and I am working on my 19th year. Of course, my monk age is 12 rainy seasons because I changed Nikayas after my 6th year. I have been living my monk life in Kauai, Hawaii for about 10 months now and things have been moving along.</description>
