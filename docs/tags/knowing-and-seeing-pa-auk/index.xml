      <description>From Knowing and Seeing Pa-Auk Forest Monastery video&#xA;In 2005 I made a video called, &amp;ldquo;Knowing and Seeing Pa-Auk Forest Monastery.&amp;rdquo; This is about the Pa-Auk Main Branch in Mawlamyine. Sayadawgyi was young back then and used to climb the stairs to his mountain kuti twice per day. I will miss that.&#xA;The title was meant to play with the name of Sayadawgyi&amp;rsquo;s famous book called, &amp;ldquo;Knowing and Seeing.&amp;rdquo; The book is referring to knowing and seeing the detailed Dhammas which were once thought impossible to know and literally &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo;.</description>
