      <description>In 1993, I visited China with five lucky School of Technology students at my University. Before going, I asked around for some cool things to say and &amp;ldquo;Chī le ma?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Have you eaten yet?&amp;rdquo; was the phrase I learned besides asking for the toilet. It does not mean what it literally says. Instead, it means a little bit like &amp;ldquo;How are you?&amp;rdquo;, but more casual like, &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s it going?</description>

      <description>The Seeds From Long Ago I remember when I first learned how to meditate on my breath some time in 1990, during my university years. Back then, meditation was not so well known. The beat generation&amp;rsquo;s Zen trend in the 60&amp;rsquo;s had died out with disco in the 70&amp;rsquo;s. Barnes and Noble maybe had only a few shelves in a single bookcase labeled with &amp;ldquo;Eastern Philosophy&amp;rdquo; that covered all Eastern religions, including Buddhism.</description>
