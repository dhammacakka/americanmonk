      <description>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amerikanische_Gro%C3%9Fschabe_1.JPG&#xA;Today I saved an upside down cockroach in my bathroom. I thought he was dead but then saw that he was still alive and moving. I was late for breakfast and decided I would save him after I came back, but I became very overwhelmed with guilt 10 seconds later and could not go further. So I grabbed a tissue and picked him up with care knowing not to squeeze too hard.</description>
