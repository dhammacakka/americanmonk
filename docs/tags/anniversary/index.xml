      <description>Eating Hall Feb 7 2022&#xA;Today is my 21rst anniversary for when I first got ordained as a monk on February 7th, 2001. As you know there was a hiccup and I ordained twice (back to back) leaving me with an official age of 15 years. However, the total years is 21 and this is my blackjack year when I first got my name.&#xA;There were many reasons why I wanted to ordain as a Buddhist Monk.</description>
