The 227 rules are grouped into seven classes with the first two, Pārājikā and Saṅghādisesā considered as &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo;. The first heavy group is also considered irrecoverable while the second requires official transactions to restore the full bhikkhu status to the offender.</description>
