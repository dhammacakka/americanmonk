      <description>Pa-Auk Bowl Blackening Foundry (not a political picture)&#xA;We have seen many Facebook selfies of politically active monks with their bowls turned upside down. What does this mean and is that proper?&#xA;The answer is: What you see on Facebook is not proper for monks or nuns. What you see on the news with monks and nuns as protesters is not proper. Overturning a bowl is an official Buddhist act, but what you have seen on Facebook and on the news are not official acts of overturning a bowl.</description>
