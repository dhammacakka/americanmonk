      <description>While I have said quite a lot to inspire people about life as a monk around the world. I should give you both sides of the story to be fair.&#xA;When you think about living in Asia full-time or just for a visit, the first thought that comes to mind is, &amp;ldquo;Will I get sick?&amp;rdquo;. It can happen, and when you rely on volunteers and health standards that work &amp;ldquo;most of the time&amp;rdquo; but not all of the time, then problems can arise.</description>

      <description>A kuṭi is a small hut or lodging that a monk lives in and it is one of the basic four requisites: Robes, Food, Lodging, &amp;amp; Medicine.

      <description>At Theravada monasteries there is no eating allowed after Noontime. Some monasteries only give one meal per day, while other monasteries give 2 meals per day. Both meal plans are allowed by the Buddha. However, some monasteries have no meals brought to the monks and they need to go out in the village and collect it. This last case is very rare and usually done by the forest monks living in secluded places or ehem.</description>
