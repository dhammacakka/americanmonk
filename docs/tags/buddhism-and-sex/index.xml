      <description>NOTE: This is a very brief version of the 25 page PDF on the subject. The free 25 page pdf download on the third precept is here. Theravada Buddhism and Sex (extended)&#xA;Summary: The third precept is defined as not having sex without the protector&amp;rsquo;s permission. It is that simple! However, the protector can be the parents, husband, guardian, brother, government, religious order, etc. You need the protector&amp;rsquo;s permission and often that is the parents in most cases.</description>
