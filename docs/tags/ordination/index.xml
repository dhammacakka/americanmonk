      <description>Probably the #1 question we get is, &amp;ldquo;Why did you become a monk?&amp;rdquo; That question has many factors and answers. However, a better question is, &amp;ldquo;How did I actually get the nerve to become a monk?&amp;rdquo; I had a lot to give up. I was a computer programmer and really enjoyed my job. It did not feel like work actually and I was also making more than 15 times what someone on minimum wage was making at that time.</description>

      <title>Are Theravada Bhikkhuni Ordinations Valid?</title>

      <description>cc0 picture https://pxhere.com/en/photo/489726&#xA;There is not much written in English explaining why bhikkhuni ordinations are rejected by the Theravāda Community of Monks. The English writings are a poor representation of the vast majority of Buddhist Scholarship and that is why there is &amp;ldquo;controversy&amp;rdquo; regarding the revival of the extinct Theravāda Bhikkhuni order. There is really no controversy to speak about once you know the full story.&#xA;Many Westerners believe that women are not able to become nuns without such a revival, but that is not true.</description>

      <title>How I Got My Name</title>

      <description>One of my earliest photos with messy robes&#xA;My original ordination certificate&#xA;Exactly twenty years ago today (February 7, 2001), I followed through with my decision to ordain with lifelong intentions. Although I am only 14 vassa because of a re-ordination ceremony, this day means more to me than my very own birthday. This day was also the day I got my name.&#xA;Today, I not only have the monk name Bhikkhu Subhūti, but I also have an actual legal passport name of Bhante Bhikkhu Subhuti as well as other essential ID&amp;rsquo;s too.</description>

      <title>Why I Ordained Twice</title>

      <description>Many people who have learned that I have re-ordained and actually know what that means have asked me why I did it. It is a long story, but I will try to be brief. During my first ordination in 2001, at Pa-Auk Main Branch with Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadaw as my preceptor, I was asked 13 questions. According to tradition, every monk is asked these 13 qualifying questions in the ordination ceremony twice.</description>
