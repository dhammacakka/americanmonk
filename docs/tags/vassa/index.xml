      <description>monks seated for the patimokkha recitation in Pa-Auk Mawlamyine&#xA;Introduction One of the things that you may notice when you visit a Buddhist monastery is that the monks sit, eat, walk, and pay respect to each other in a certain order. This order is based on the principle of seniority, which is determined by the date of ordination, not by age, education, or social status. Whoever is ordained earlier is considered senior, and whoever is ordained later is considered junior.</description>

      <description>Monks walking up the monastery road near the library 2014. (Double umbrella)&#xA;Excerpt from Going For Broke: Monasterynote5: Walkman Karaoke, 2004&#xA;Rainy Season is luckily my favorite and I love all five months of it. It is the perfect temperature also, not too hot, not too cold. It&amp;rsquo;s quiet and the noises around me get white washed out from the rain striking the metal corrugated roofing. We had over 350 Bhikkhus and a total of more than 600 residents this past Rainy Season (2004).</description>

      <description>Recently, I got a nice message from a monk friend telling me he was taking vassa (3 month Rainy Season Retreat) on July 23rd (the Full Moon Day) and wishing me a happy vassa before he goes offline for three months. However, we at Pa-Auk are taking the vassa today on July 24 (the day after the Full Moon Day). The calendars often say it starts on the Full Moon Day, but we don&amp;rsquo;t do that at Pa-Auk.</description>
