      <description>Here are a five remarkable stories of miracles to tell, but not all of them. There have been many miracles that have come my way when I needed them the most. For the Christians out there, they might say, “Doesn’t that make you believe in God?” My answer is, “It makes me believe there are heavenly beings (Devas &amp;amp; Devis)) who are looking out for me.”. There are other stories not included such as &amp;ldquo;My Watch Story&amp;rdquo;</description>
