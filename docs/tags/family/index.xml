      <description>My family&#xA;I did a brief visit with my parents on the corner of October and November. Although I have stayed separately at my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house on the previous last two visits in 2006 and 2008, I had arranged for the porch-sun-room to be modified as a &amp;ldquo;separate lodging&amp;rdquo; for me in 2019. If you do the math, that means I have not visited Connecticut in eleven years. This in-house lodging arrangement worked out and instead of being 60 miles away and only getting a few visits in with my folks, I was able to spend some good quality time with them during the majority of my week long stay.</description>
