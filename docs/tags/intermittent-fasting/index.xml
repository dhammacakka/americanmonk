      <description>Did the Buddha do intermittent fasting? The answer is: Yes.&#xA;When I first became a monk, people were shocked about how I gave up eating after Solar Noon and I have not eaten dinner in over 20 years. Sometimes I switch to one meal per day, but I often find a light breakfast, mostly liquid foods or rice soup, with a full lunch works best for me. These days, many people are using intermittent fasting as a form of weight loss and when I describe my Buddhist monk diet, they give a nod and say &amp;ldquo;Intermittent Fasting&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s Healthy.</description>
