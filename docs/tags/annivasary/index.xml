      <description>The standing marble Buddha at Pyin Oo Lwin Pa-Auk&#xA;On Feb 7th, 2001 I took my original ordination with The Most Venerable Pa-Auk Saydawgyi.

Although there was a small hiccup, it has been 19 years total. I had just finished arranging my residential visa that was said could not be changed from a tourist visa without leaving the country.</description>
