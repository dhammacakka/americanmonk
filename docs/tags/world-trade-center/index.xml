      <description>cc WTC 9/11, 2001 wikimedia Attribution: Robert J. Fisch&#xA;&amp;ldquo;They always wanted to get that building&amp;rdquo;&#xA;That was what I said when I first heard about 9/11 three or four days later.&#xA;I once had a job interview at Merrill Lynch in The World Financial Center which was connected to The World Trade Center by a sky bridge. My goal was to eventually work at WTC, but luckily I didn&amp;rsquo;t get that job and it was the only job interview I didn&amp;rsquo;t get an offer on.</description>
