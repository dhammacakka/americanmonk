      <description>cc WTC 9/11, 2001 wikimedia Attribution: Robert J. Fisch&#xA;&amp;ldquo;They always wanted to get that building&amp;rdquo;&#xA;That was what I said when I first heard about 9/11 three or four days later.&#xA;I once had a job interview at Merrill Lynch in The World Financial Center which was connected to The World Trade Center by a sky bridge. My goal was to eventually work at WTC, but luckily I didn&amp;rsquo;t get that job and it was the only job interview I didn&amp;rsquo;t get an offer on.</description>

      <description>September 11th and Jeremy Glick&#xA;I have a personal story I want to tell you about Jeremy Glick and September 11, 2001. The short story is that my name is Jeremy Glick and I was a computer programmer. However, I had left my regular world in 1999 and people who have lost track of me remembered me when 9/11 happened. About seven months after I ordained as a Buddhist Monk in 2001, the famous 9/11 or September 11th event happened.</description>
