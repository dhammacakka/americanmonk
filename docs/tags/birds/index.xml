      <description>Is it OK to feed uncooked rice to the birds?&#xA;Recently, the subject about feeding animals in my post Sabbe-Satta-Metta was brought up and how it could end up hurting animals in the long run. I answered it as &amp;ldquo;hogwash,&amp;rdquo; and then questioned the validity of the myth of throwing rice at weddings since I see people feed birds with uncooked rice all of the time in Burma. If it killed the birds, we would surely know about it and stop doing it.</description>
