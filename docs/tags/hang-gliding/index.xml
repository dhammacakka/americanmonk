      <description>Below is a Wrigley’s TV commercial from the 80s which started my lifelong dream to hang-glide and a genuine excuse to get educated.

Thanks to youtube, I can trace it all back.&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ87pBjQt0k&#xA;I was never really college material, I took the SAT’s once and bombed on them.</description>
