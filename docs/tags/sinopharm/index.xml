      <description>Injection on Western resident monk&#xA;Pa-Auk finally vaccinated 2000 of its residents across its branch monasteries with a privately sponsored SinoPharm vaccine. Pa-Auk Pyin Oo Lwin branch had its vaccines delivered on September 18th, 2021 with about half of the total population signed up. Vaccination was voluntary and provided by donors.&#xA;While it did take a long time for us to get the vaccine, the government did invite us for the vaccine back in April or May 2021.</description>
