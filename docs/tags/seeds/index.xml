      <description>The Seeds From Long Ago I remember when I first learned how to meditate on my breath some time in 1990, during my university years. Back then, meditation was not so well known. The beat generation&amp;rsquo;s Zen trend in the 60&amp;rsquo;s had died out with disco in the 70&amp;rsquo;s. Barnes and Noble maybe had only a few shelves in a single bookcase labeled with &amp;ldquo;Eastern Philosophy&amp;rdquo; that covered all Eastern religions, including Buddhism.</description>
