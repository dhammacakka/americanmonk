      <description>In the eight plus years that I have lived in Myanmar, I have never seen the Thingyan Water Festival festivities happening in the street.

However, our Kyownpine monastery goes out on alms round a little later so we can collect real food to actually eat a little bit easier (so the donors have time to cook).</description>
