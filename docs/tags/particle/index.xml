      <description>Irrawaddi River, Bagan, 2015&#xA;There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about what the Abhidhamma is all about. If I were to describe a river based on Suttanta values and then describe it again in terms of Abhidhamma and commentary values, Abhidhamma will be very clear in its validity and purpose. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall the Buddha explaining rivers in Suttas in the way I will explain them. However, I will try to explain them &amp;ldquo;as if&amp;rdquo; they were spoken in the Suttas and also &amp;ldquo;as if&amp;rdquo; they were mentioned in the Abhidhamma and Commentaries.</description>
