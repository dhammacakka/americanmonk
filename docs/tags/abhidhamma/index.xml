      <description>Irrawaddi River, Bagan, 2015&#xA;There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about what the Abhidhamma is all about. If I were to describe a river based on Suttanta values and then describe it again in terms of Abhidhamma and commentary values, Abhidhamma will be very clear in its validity and purpose. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall the Buddha explaining rivers in Suttas in the way I will explain them. However, I will try to explain them &amp;ldquo;as if&amp;rdquo; they were spoken in the Suttas and also &amp;ldquo;as if&amp;rdquo; they were mentioned in the Abhidhamma and Commentaries.</description>

      <description>Free Book: Abhidhamma Lessons PDF Download Abhidhamma Lessons PDF Here is a book I wrote long ago that relates the Abhidhamma to Computer Science. As a programmer from the nineties, I &amp;ldquo;clicked&amp;rdquo; with the abhidhamma after reading just a small amount. When I learned that the mind does only one thing at a time, it instantly clicked with a graduate class I had taken on digital circuits. It gave me the faith in the Abhidhamma early on which is very rare among Western Monks and Western Theravada Buddhist lay people.</description>
