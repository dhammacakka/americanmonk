      <description>Probably the #1 question we get is, &amp;ldquo;Why did you become a monk?&amp;rdquo; That question has many factors and answers. However, a better question is, &amp;ldquo;How did I actually get the nerve to become a monk?&amp;rdquo; I had a lot to give up. I was a computer programmer and really enjoyed my job. It did not feel like work actually and I was also making more than 15 times what someone on minimum wage was making at that time.</description>
