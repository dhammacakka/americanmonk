      <description>Autopsy Table found on Wikipedia. The table we saw did not have &amp;ldquo;containment walls&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Is it true that forest monks actually attend autopsies? Yes it is actually quite common. After being a monk for perhaps more than 10 years, I remember a senior monk expressing surprise when he discovered I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen one. He said, “You haven’t been to an autopsy yet?”&#xA;&amp;ldquo;You haven&amp;rsquo;t been to an autopsy yet?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Ven Ananda with the two donors&#xA;Recently, we received six new tables arranged by a monk&amp;rsquo;s two donors. The tables were nice but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we needed them, so I asked the monk why. He said there was not enough room on the tables for his donors&amp;rsquo; donations, so they decided to donate more tables so they can donate more. When his donors make donations, they are not small.</description>
