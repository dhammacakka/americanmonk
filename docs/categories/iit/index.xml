      <description>Ven Ananda with the two donors&#xA;Recently, we received six new tables arranged by a monk&amp;rsquo;s two donors. The tables were nice but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we needed them, so I asked the monk why. He said there was not enough room on the tables for his donors&amp;rsquo; donations, so they decided to donate more tables so they can donate more. When his donors make donations, they are not small.</description>
