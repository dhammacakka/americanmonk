      <description>This Dhamma talk discusses the key elements of the Kāladāna Sutta in addition to three personal stories that show how donations can miraculously come back to you.

      <description>That is me going for alms on Aalona Street Kilauea.&#xA;I have a Christmas story for you. I have tried to keep it short but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out.&#xA;When I was in Kaua&amp;rsquo;i on from 2017-2019, an 18 month run, I made it a point to go for alms by the house to house loving-kindness method on Tuesdays and Wednesdays as a way to get food. Early on, I was invited to Waiapua Road while standing in front of Hanalei Big Save which was my Monday stop.</description>

      <description>I remember when I was living in Kaua&amp;rsquo;i in a tent propped up in the corner of my friend Uncle Gene Taylor&amp;rsquo;s property. I had just come home from my daily alms round and I popped into his room to say hello. He is old and has difficulty walking, yet he is usually quite cheerful. As part of the visit routine, he asked me how my day was and I smiled and happily said, &amp;ldquo;Today was a great day.</description>

      <description>All-focus&#xA;As the rest of the song goes.. &amp;ldquo;And I don&amp;rsquo;t know when I&amp;rsquo;ll be back again.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It has been almost 1.5 years living on Kaua&amp;rsquo;i. I have had an incredible experience here by doing an experiment to see if a monk can establish a monastery any place he travels to through the lost art of wandering for alms. A practice done in the name of the Buddha but rarely practised anymore.</description>

      <title>Ian (exVen. Visarada) Visits Kauai</title>

      <description>This past July, I had an old friend named Ian Sloan (previously Venerable Visarada ) visit me in Kauai. He disrobed after being a monk for 25 years. He disrobed because of a conflict of philosophy about what happens at death. It was a combination of accounts from past life regressions in hypnotherapy, what he has read by Edgar Cayce, and the event of his father&amp;rsquo;s death. He seems to appreciate the Near Death Experiences which can still be explained partially with Buddhism, but he felt it was time to disrobe.</description>

      <description>Recently, I ran into a very angry man who came out of his house yelling at me and coming closer and closer. Eventually, I won the fight with my two big weapons, loving-kindness and my commitment of being free from money for all these years. I have been going for alms in this neighborhood for a little over a year now, and while I did have two girls yell at me, they did not leave their property boundary.</description>

      <description>Koral&amp;rsquo;s Family&#xA;Just about every Wednesday, I still find the time to continue with my Kilauea alms round[mfn]map is here[/mfn] (which used to include Tuesdays too). I take a one hour bus ride from Lihue, and then set out on my alms round, wishing loving-kindness to the houses one by one as I walk along the road.&#xA;In the beginning people thought I was some weird homeless person who might be crazy, but after some time, some fearless people spoke to me and then word started spreading.</description>

Things were going well at the place where I was at before in Kilauea. The owner was happy with what I was doing for the community and I was happy and fulfilled with what I was doing for the community as well. Unfortunately, the owner&amp;rsquo;s son came for a visit. In short, he said, &amp;ldquo;I want to visit a monk.</description>

      <description>I recently changed my name officially to Bhante Bhikkhu Subhuti. I have been wanting to do this for a very long time but, unfortunately, I was unable to do it because the name change process has to be done in the probate court where one has residency. Since I had spent most of my time in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, it was just not possible, until recently. After being in Hawaii for a while, I committed to staying for at least three months longer to complete the name change process.</description>

      <description>This is where I live&#xA;Wow! Today is February 7th and another year has passed. I have now completed 18 years total as a monk and I am working on my 19th year. Of course, my monk age is 12 rainy seasons because I changed Nikayas after my 6th year. I have been living my monk life in Kauai, Hawaii for about 10 months now and things have been moving along.</description>

      <description>On a warm Hawaiian Christmas day in 2018, I was off to collect my alms in the village. I was in a rush and worried that I would not be able to find a ride to the village where I go for alms because so few cars would be on the roads. Luckily, I got a ride and as I stepped out of the the car, I did my usual baggage check.</description>

      <description>Here is the link to the 2015 KKCR radio show. We were interviewed on Kauai Community Radio for about one hour instead of the scheduled 20 minutes. We all had fun doing it. It will give you a good taste of what we did on the island in 2015 and what I am doing now. I often enjoy revisiting this recording, and I hope you do too.&#xA;[archiveorg id=oasis111518-2]</description>

      <description>Here are a five remarkable stories of miracles to tell, but not all of them. There have been many miracles that have come my way when I needed them the most. For the Christians out there, they might say, “Doesn’t that make you believe in God?” My answer is, “It makes me believe there are heavenly beings (Devas &amp;amp; Devis)) who are looking out for me.”. There are other stories not included such as &amp;ldquo;My Watch Story&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Kauai Update #3&#xA;I have moved from the Botanical Gardens recently. I was able to stay there for 5 months and the majority of the time there was wonderful. However things were changing and it was time for me to look for another place and now I am staying in a new long term location in Kilauea.&#xA;It all happened after a wonderful person picked me up on the side of the road holding my signs the day my parents, brother and in-law dropped me off (I’ll get back to that family-visit part later).</description>

      <description>As a Buddhist Monk collecting alms in Kauai, USA for the past 4 months, the results are in. On Tuesday and Wednesdays as shown on the map above, I collect my food, wishing loving-kindness to one side of the street at a time. So how many houses have given food at least once? About 18 people from different houses have given me food at least once. About 4 or 5 cars have given to me, but they are not included in the 18 number.</description>

      <description>With only 5 minutes left before we were supposed to start, the security guard told us that someone else had the room booked and we would need to move to a smaller amd inferior room. It was a mistake on their part, and while I did ask to see the schedule book, I opted out because we were running out of time and needed to setup the room again. It was disturbing and noisy, but we had to make the best of it.</description>

There are some restrictions though. I spoke with a lawyer who seemed to know civil liberties quite well, but there are no guarantees with what I say. However, this information should make sense and seem legal to you. It is legal to ring the doorbell of any house and preach to them or talk to them about politics under the freedom of speech rights.</description>

      <description>Aloha!&#xA;It has been a little over a month since I have been on the island of Kauai. Things have been going well although my situation is still the same. I am still in a tent at Anini, but I have a new tent in Anini with a better view of the pristine Kauai shore! Things are dryer than the record rains we had last month.. and I guess if it were wetter than before a new record would be set.</description>

      <description>Kauai Update April 22 Aloha! I have been in Kauai since April 9th. It has been a rough start but things are getting better everyday. If you have paid attention to the news, you may have noticed an unheard of 30&amp;quot; of rain in 24 hours. Actually, there were several days of incredible amounts of rain, but only the third day broke the records. See https:www.washingtonpost.com&#xA;I was in a tent in Anini Park during that time and I am still in Anini Park.</description>

As usual, for the disclaimer, I am only 11 Vassa in official years. But Wow! Now it is finally starting to seem like a long time!&#xA;I have been blessed with a wonderful adult life. I worked as a professional for only about six years, got paid like a doctor, and felt relaxed and at ease the majority of the time that I worked.</description>

      <description>When Ven. Devananda and I traveled to Kauai in 2015, we did not have a Kappiya (helper) to buy us food or even pay for our luggage. One can live without helpers, but it does take some pre-planning.&#xA;We had a ticket from Yangon to Honolulu that was dirt cheap at only $854 for a round trip fare. However, it came with 12 hour and 6 hour layovers in China.</description>

      <description>A 2 part Powerpoint presentation about what two monks did in Kauai, Hawaii during June to December 2015. The theme was propagation, but the propagation was done just from being monks who do not touch money, and collect their food the traditional Buddhist monk way. The vision, how it got started, stories and experiences were shared. About 50 people were in the audience. Running time is about 1 hour total for both.</description>

      <description>I remember when I went to America in 2008 with one of my monastic friends named Ven. Visarada. He was an experienced monk and had good ascetic practices. When we went to America, he did not have any luggage and brought everything he owned with him. Instead of using luggage, he used a simple cardboard box. It is simple, easy to get, easy to dispose of and also more suitable for a monk than fancy luggage.</description>

There was a lady on a bicycle who approached us and asked us what we were doing. Her tone of voice was not so happy, but we enjoy telling people what we are doing because it does not happen so often and that is one of our goals when we stand in front of each house.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I had spoken about how someone took our pictures and who said something like, &amp;ldquo;I just wanted to tell you (her hand was now over her heart) how much &amp;hellip;what you do means to me. I really want to thank you for what you are doing!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;She drove off in her electric car that sounded like a vacuum cleaner. A few moments later, the same vacuum cleaner showed up again, and then she asked if she could take our picture.</description>

      <title>Very Sweet Indeed</title>

      <description>Yesterday, we got some pre-Halloween candy during our alms round at one of the houses. I thought that was very &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo; of our donor.&#xA;Halloween is a holiday on October 31, in America where kids dress up as, well, anything they want. They go around the neighborhood at night and ring the doorbells and say &amp;ldquo;Trick or treat!&amp;rdquo;. Then the person at the house would place some candy inside the ambitiously sized candy collection bags.</description>

      <description>We spend almost an hour at the library on Tuesdays when we wait for the Thai Restaurant to open. Ven. Dewananda signed this book out of the library called, &amp;ldquo;Free Spirit.&amp;rdquo; I was curious since &amp;ldquo;Free Spirit&amp;rdquo; was the name of my family&amp;rsquo;s sailboat when I was a kid. While I was flicking through the book, which by the way was well written, I came across this quote that struck me.</description>

      <description>The website Http://TimeAndDate.com is a &amp;ldquo;must-know&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;must-have&amp;rdquo; for Buddhist monks, especially when they travel abroad. It calculates the Moon Phases and Solar Noon for a specific area. One thing that was very enlightening was how the Western calendars were off from the Buddhist calendars for the new and full moons.&#xA;Why?&#xA;Well&amp;hellip; pick a place in the East, like Yangon and see when the full moon is. Then pick a place in the far West like Honolulu and see when the full moon is.</description>

      <description>My friend Nikita (x ven Kippabinnya) made this flyer for our new location. There was a request to move to Kapaa which is more central. Golden Lotus seems like a nice place and they have cushions and chairs available.</description>

      <description>I had to ask Bhante Devananda several times in order to go to the end of the road to see the ocean today. We have been at this location for six weeks now without ever going to the ocean at the end of our own road. However, after we got there, Bhante Devananda did not want to leave. Being the nice monk I am, I let us stay and we meditated on the mountain until it got dark.</description>

      <description>I am still happy to report that things are continuing to go well. However, we did have a small hiccup, OK, a big one. We moved.&#xA;Yes, I know it was beautiful place we had, and maybe the most beautiful place in Kauai too. But something was just not right and so we decided to move out and we are in a new place on a three acre tropical fruit orchard.</description>

      <description>There is a Bodhi Tree on our property and we sometimes do a vandana (chanting) in front of this tree rather than at the gazebo. We did one tonight until a passing rain cloud sprinkled on us.&#xA;From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi_Tree The Bodhi Tree, also known as Bo (from Sinhalese: Bo) and &amp;ldquo;peepal tree&amp;rdquo; in Nepal and Bhutan, was a large and very old sacred fig tree (Ficus religiosa[1])[2] located in Bodh Gaya, India, under which Siddhartha Gautama, the spiritual teacher later known as Gautama Buddha, is said to have attained enlightenment, or Bodhi.</description>

      <description>Report on Kauai&#xA;I am pleased to write you with a very happy report on our trip to Kauai. We have been doing really good work and things have been working out well. My concepts and ideas about Kauai as a special place for monks to live and practice has met and and exceeded my expectations. I feel it is very good for my overall monk life and development. Instead of relying on a big monastery structure for my needs, I need to keep on my toes in order to survive.</description>

      <description>This is a picture of the Waimea Canyon Trail. I recommend going on the Canyon Trail Hike and going further beyond the small waterfall and then to the edge of the cliff where the top of another huge waterfall is. The view is so spectacular.</description>

      <description>Our bus passes start on July 1. However, Kauai is easy to hitchhike on. To make things difficult, I do not want to use my thumb and just let people guess. The result?&#xA;It is really easy and I regret having passes, although it is easy that way.&#xA;Today we got a ride from someone who went to Kula High School where I used to teach in 2000. She knew our road and drove us door to door.</description>
