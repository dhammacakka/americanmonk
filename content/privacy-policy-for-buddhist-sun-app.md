Reference location data and Buddhist Sun’s use and handling of location data
What Personal Data Does Buddhist Sun use to operate and Why?

GPS and location:
Buddhist Sun uses GPS services to help you collect the GPS latitude /longitude for calculating the sun position, so you can know when Solar Noon is. There is no data sent back to the creators / owners of Buddhist Sun app. GPS is only used once each time you press the button to collect the GPS coordinates.

Running in the background:
Buddhist Sun requests run in the background when you specifically use the switch to “enable TTS with screen off” . This allows the text to speech engine to work while the phone screen is not on so you may get voice notifications as the timer runs. Without this background permission, you will not be able to get hands free voice notifications when the screen is not on. Alternatively, you can choose never to turn this switch on. The app is designed so that the background processes are turned on only when it is requested with a switch. You can operate the app without using the switch. The permission is only asked one time. When the app is closed, the background process is turned off. This is independent from the above GPS permissions. GPS is not streamed. GPS is only requested once as specified by the user single button interaction. This app will not run secretly. When the app is turned off, so are the background processes.

User Preferences:
Buddhist Sun stores information locally related to the city selected from the internal database of 40,000+ cities. Buddhist Sun also stores GPS coordinates. Currently one city, one GPS coordinate, and one offset are stored based off user input. Other information stored in preferences are for the operation of the application. This information is not encrypted.

Specifically covering user privacy:
We believe privacy is important. We do not collect any information. There is no gain to the app owner except merit in this Buddhist Sun application. We want to help you follow the Buddhist rules on eating before Solar Noon. Nothing is sold to you or other third parties. The only information given to us is from Google, which is anonymous, regarding the number of downloads or the number of installs, country of origin, some crash reports and other useful information regarding store downloads. We do not receive personal information.
