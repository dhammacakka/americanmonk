These days, most meditators meditate inside buildings on flat and hard surfaces. One should try to meditate outside on a nice grassy area that has a 20 to 30Â° angle. It does not take much to find such a place and if you do, you might feel there is no need for pillows or other bulky equipment for your comfort. Go ahead and give it a \*try!

Wrapping a robe or a bedsheet around your body can reduce the need for bug spray. Remember to try to keep things simple when you want to simplify your mind!

\*If there is no Lyme disease in your area.
