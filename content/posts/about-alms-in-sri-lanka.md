description:  "Video:  Exploring Alms In Sri Lanka"

This video is about alms giving in Sri Lanka, also known as piṇḍapāta. I share my experiences of collecting alms in Sri Lanka and comparing them to alms giving in other countries like Myanmar and Thailand.

In Sri Lanka, alms giving is a daily routine for monks. People wait outside their houses with rice and curries, and the monks walk by collecting food in their bowls. This is different from other countries where monks might go out in groups and collect alms together. In Sri Lanka, even when going alone, people are generous and provide a balanced meal to the monks.

I describe how people in the village anticipate the monks’ arrival. They might set out a chair and have food ready beforehand. Children are especially excited and inform their parents about the monks’ arrival. People show respect by bowing down to the monks.

The devoted donors often fill the monks’ bowls with rice first, then add curries on top. The monks try to take only a small portion and leave the rest for others.  After collecting alms, monks return to the monastery and sort the collected food and give to the other monks before taking it among themselves.

I find alms giving in Sri Lanka to be a very positive experience. I feel a sense of obligation to accept what is offered, even though Sri Lanka is currently facing an economic crisis.  I feel happy to see that people are still generous despite the economic hardship. I believe that the villagers’ generosity is contributing to their success, as evidenced by the new brick houses being built in the village.  The video ends with expressing my hope that everyone involved in alms giving and even watching this video will benefit and reach Nibbana.
