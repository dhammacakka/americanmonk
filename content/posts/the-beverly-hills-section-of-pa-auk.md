**The "Beverly Hills" Section of Pa-Auk**  
This is my neighborhood. Over the years, the price of wood had skyrocketed, and concrete kuties have become the new standard. However, that does not stop them from laying teak floors inside. I think teak is quite inexpensive in Myanmar compared to the rest of the world. The same could be said about flowers and mangoes, let alone medicine and treatment.  
  
This neighborhood is quite old now and some other kuti donor/builders have really "gone out to town."  
  
Kuti #93 recently burned down. It was a wood kuti painted with old engine oil for bugs and weather protection, a fire hazard in itself. A "black kuti" as we now call them. They go back to 2001 or earlier. A battery charger was blamed for the fire.ï»¿
