Here is a picture of my old kuti (#123) from 2001 to 2005.  At that time nearly all kuties were what we now call  "Black Kuties."  They are black because they were painted every so often with a new coat of used engine oil to keep the bugs out and to "finish" the wood at the same time.  Sayadaw U Punnyananda was living there before I moved in.  He must have been two vassa then. Sayadaw U Revata was in #125 down the road.﻿
