**Early Morning Rounds**  
A picture of another group of monks going on alms round during my own early morning alms in Intakkaw, Myanmar. November, 2013. One of my many reason for being a monk, besides Nibbana, was not touching money and collecting food with a monk's bowl among other things. Life is good this way.  
  
I remember telling my grandfather that I wanted to become a monk and beg for food when he was in the hospital fighting cancer. While I should have used a different expression for "begging," that was how it came out and he was not so happy to hear that. (And talk about bad timing....) Nevertheless, he was happy to know I would travel the globe. He recovered before I left home, but had a relapse later on. I am sure he enjoyed my stories from Kauai, Hawaii and I was only five months into my trip which did not have an end or destination in mind.  
  
When he first learned about my travel plans, he told me a story about a man he spoke to long ago on his docked boat who was sailing around the world. He said to him, "You know, you've got a lot of balls to do this.". The man replied, "You know, I would have a lot of balls _not_ to do this."  
The final words from "Father and Son," a song always dear to my heart comes to mind.  
"I know, I've got to go away."  
  
During my travels, I was being evacuated from Fiji during the uprising of 2000 because the place I was staying at got torched with a fire bomb. When I called my folks to let them know I was OK, my uncle answered my mother's cell phone at the hospital, which was strange. I found out my grandfather had relapsed and he did not want me to know so that I would continue with my journey. Everyone was there saying their last goodbyes and I was sort of connected there too. He died the next day, but part of his personality survives in me today.
