3 pics on transportation in Myanmar.  
  
1\. The taxes on cars are less expensive than before, but still expensive. For example, a used (legal) Toyota Land Cruiser may have cost $200,000 USD in 2001. 
To get around this, it is now very common to buy a tractor engine and make a truck out of it. They are used for hauling just about anything, including school children.  
Myanmar was once known as a place where you could still see ox and pony carts, but they are quickly becoming a thing of the past.  
  
  
2\. This form of transportation is still a very common sight in Myanmar. Often you will see 6 or more men riding by standing on the bumper and holding to the top bar with their hands.  
  
3\. Evidence of embargo state..recycling..ï»¿
