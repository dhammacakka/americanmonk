**A Sidecar Scooter**  
Made in Myanmar. I have seen 10 or more school children ride in one of these during my stay in Intakkaw near Yangon. Taxis can often be a 2 wheeled scooter where you and another ride on the back. You will be hard pressed to find the typical Indian Auto rickshaws in Myanmar.  
The picture was taken in front of the Sangha Hospital Ward during an out patient visit to the ENT Doctor.ï»¿
