OK, This was the first question for English competency. Try to figure out what to write!  
Yes, you bet I asked and so did a lot of others. I should pass both the English and Buddhism sections. About 4 hours of continuous writing in two sessions. This year they did not ask any questions with technical grammer labels from my 6th grade english books I am no longer familiar with. Tomorrow is the oral exam, though we have not been told when or where! I have seen the exams from real classes and they look more lugit. It might be fun to be a student again. If I pass and I am accepted, I will have the option to attend without obligation and I can also take leave for meditation as I wish.ï»¿
