This is a spoken English version of the Discourse on Loving-Kindness (Metta Sutta), mixed with the Pāi chanting of One Voice (EkaSara). I like it and I think you will too. Enjoy!  If you get a chance, It is best listened with headphones.  There is quite a bit of stereophonic separation included.  Feedback welcome.  The audio is uploaded [here.](https://archive.org/details/MettaOnevoiceEnglishmix6Session)
