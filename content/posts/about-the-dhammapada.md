## Dhammapada Commentary Stories
The Dhammapada is located in the Khuddaka Nikāya of the Sutta Piṭaka and it was arranged by the first Buddhist Council.  Its verses (gāthā) were spoken by the Buddha shortly after an incident happened.  The verse can be seen as a "Moral of the Story" that summed up the lessons to be learned.  The commentary to the Dhammapada contains many of the stories where the verses are pulled from and we can understand that the commentaries were not a later invention if the Dhammapada was compiled by the First Council.  The Commentaries were translated under the title "Buddhist Legends", which were part of the esteemed Harvard Oriental Series.  They were some of the first Pāḷi texts to be translated and are now in the public domain because of the time past since the author's death.  Because the scholars chose this to be one of the first works to translate, you should understand that it is an important text for all Buddhist to read.  Some famous stories found in Buddhist Legends include:
- Ciñcā falsely accuses the Buddha,  
- Not Hatred for Hatred,  
- Paṭācārā (lost family), 
- Kisā Gotamī (mustard seeds)

If you are a seasoned Buddhist, you might recognize some of these classic stories. In Asian Theravādan countries, it is very common for the monks to give a daily anumodana (rejoicing and thanks-giving) talk based on a verse and the related story.  The teachings are rich and often have past life information which can help one understand cause and effect.

## Themes
The Dhammapada covers ethical conduct, mental discipline, and philosophical insight.  It also contains practical advice for daily living and the attainments of the spiritual perfections.
Laypeople and monastic will enjoy the themes which range from:
- Anger management, 
- Faith, 
- Good friendship 
- Mindfulness, insight and the development of wisdom. 
- Spiritual liberation.  

## Pāḷi Meter or Pāḷi Poetry (Gāthā)
The poetry of the Dhammapada is not a rhyming poetry that speakers of English might be used to.  It consists of Metered verses called gāthā, which are based on the number of beats or syllables that are contained in each line.  Usually 8 syllables are arranged in one line, but sometimes more are used for different patterns.  Long vowels such as "ā" get a longer pronounced time than for a short vowel "a".  The same can be said about double consonants.  This system of metered verses provides a rhythmic way of expressing words together to give a profound meaning.  It is pleasant to hear, and also easier to remember.

## Using Poetry As A Memory Aid
The teachings of the Buddha were originally memorized and kept in memory, chanted in groups.  Only later were the teachings written down.  Just as Rhyming poetry can help one remember what will come next, in the same way tones and rhythm can also do the same to aid with memory.

It is common for monks to memorize the Dhammapada.  If you want to become a PhD student at ITBMU, you will need to have the entire 423 verses in memory.  The monk will be given the first line and then he must complete the other lines to make up the full verse.  At {{< extlink "https://americanmonk.org/international-institute-of-theravada/" "The International Institute of Theravāda" >}}, we are memorizing the entire Dhammapada over the course of 2 years.  We are doing this 7+ verses at a time.  While it is not required to keep the entire book in the mind at once, it is still very useful. We will finish 224 verses by mid October.  The benefits are below:

- Vocabulary is learned for each word
- Grammar is learned for each word or verse
- The verse is repeated over and over again for memory
- A deeper knowledge of each verse is obtained compared to one who has simply read the verse one time.

## Conclusion

They cover a variety of universal themes that often go beyond religious bounds.  Because of this, The Dhammapada is an excellent book for all Buddhists to refer to, and that is why it is one of the most popular and most important Buddhist books translated into English today.
