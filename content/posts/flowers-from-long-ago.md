**Flowers From Long Ago**  
I remember the one time in my lay life when a woman brought me flowers, and for no particular reason either. I had her over my place a few times to play guitar. She was just learning and I thought it would be fun to have her over to play guitar with her. We knew each other from an NGO that did some volunteer work with some kids at a housing project. We used to take them ice-skating or for other activities like mini-golf and pizza. I was a regular helper and so was she.  
  
When she brought me flowers, I think she had seen earlier that my flowers I bought for myself were kept a few days longer than the appropriate shelf life. She wanted to brighten up my room when she visited me. I remember being on "Cloud-Nine" while I was putting them in a vase with water. Elated in the kitchen while she was in the next room, I said like a child loudly to nobody but myself,  
"You brought me flowers! She brought me flowers!" :-) :-) :-)  
  
During that time, I was not interested in her as a girlfriend, but that event certainly ranks high on my big list of "One of the nicest things anyone has done for me" when I was a layman.  
  
Much time has passed since then and I have been a monk for many years. In Buddhism we learn that people, relationships and just about everything else are only like flowers.  
  
_They are all impermanent._  
  
Now that I am a monk, I can get perpetual flowers for my Buddha nearly all of the time at Pa-Auk and "Cloud-Nine" is no stranger. _However, all things are transient._  
  
**My usual flower reflection in Pāḷi is below with an English translation**:  
  
Ayaṁ puppha-pūjā Buddha-pacceka-buddha-agga-sāvaka- mahā-sāvaka-arahantādīnaṁ sabhāva-sīlaṃ. Aham'pi tesaṃ anuvattako homi.  
  
**This flower-offering is a natural practice of Buddhas, Silent-buddhas, Chief Disciples, Great Disciples, Arahants, etc. I, too, am a follower of their \[practice\].**  
  
  
Idaṃ pupphaṃ idāni vaṇṇena'pi suvaṇṇaṃ gandhena'pi su- gandhaṃ saṇṭhānena'pi susaṇṭhānaṁ. Khippam-eva dubbaṇ-ṇaṃ duggandhaṁ dussaṇṭhānaṃ aniccataṁ pāpuṇissati.  
  
**This flower is now beautiful with colour; fragrant with scent; with form well shaped, \[but\] soon it will become discoloured, foul-smelling and disfigured**.  
  
  
Evam-eva kho sabbe saṇkhārā aniccā, sabbe saṇkhārā dukkhā, sabbe dhammā anattā'ti.  
  
**So, too, all compounded things are impermanent and painful, and all things (conditioned and unconditioned) are not self**.  
  
  
(It was a long time ago and my memory may have varied a bit. This was the hybrid version that came to my mind)
