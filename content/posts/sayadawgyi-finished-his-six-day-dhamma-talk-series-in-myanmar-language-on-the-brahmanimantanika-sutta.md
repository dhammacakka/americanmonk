Sayadawgyi finished his six day Dhamma Talk series in Myanmar Language on The Brahmanimantanika Sutta. His first words were about America and the wrong views about Buddhism there. He shouted his lion's roar and several thousand devotees came to see him. Venerable U Dhammasena was recruited to continue the translation. It was amazing how he was able to translate Sayadaw's bullet train Dhamma talk style in realtime. It was stressful but he was grateful for the opportunity. The big problem was too much energy afterwards. I know the feeling. I was charged. About 100 to 150 people could tune in to the translation for the first time. We do not know the exact numbers since it was transmitted as a radio station. Uncountable listeners and uncountable merit.﻿
