**Before and After Water Filter**  
I have been using this water filter for about a month or so now. It is working well and I have not had brown water days yet! I was going to leave because of the water and my ear problems which has now turned into Tinnitus. That is not fun when you meditate as your main gig. I asked a friend of mine, U Jotika who had offered a filter for me long ago when he showed me around his new kuti which also had a filter. Although it was so long ago and he forgot that he offered me, he was happy to help via his parents who are local in Mudon. Sadhu!
