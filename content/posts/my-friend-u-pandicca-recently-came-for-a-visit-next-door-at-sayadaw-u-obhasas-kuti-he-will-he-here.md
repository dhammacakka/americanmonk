My friend U Pandicca recently came for a visit next door at Sayadaw U Obhasa's kuti. He will he here for one week and then return to Yangon for his studies. He has recently returned from India where he and his friend gave a Kidney donations to those in need. Sadhu sadhu sadhu!  
  
Sayadaw U Obhasa attracts high-loving-kindness bhikkhus and I am happy to have him as my neighbor :-D  
  
"Sayadaw" is a title which means "teacher," usually given to very senior or accomplished monks
