????Soooo. A while back, I said I had Hawaii on my mind and that a string of flowers was starting to look different. Today, the door just opened up. The USA visa was approved for my friend who will be my monastic companion. A "good friend" is a good friend in-deed. I smile when I hear or say the word Kauai. Soon we will walk and meditate inside that world. It is something I had dreamed of doing as a monk, long before I ever ordained.ï»¿
