**Otoscope In The Monk's Clinic**  
It is always nice to see something that I arranged being used in the clinic as standard equipment.  
I am sure the donor of the clinic itself feels a hundred times better.  
  
Btw: An otoscope is the standard device doctors use to look inside your ears. I have _never_ seen a general practitioner anywhere in Sri Lanka or Myanmar have one of these on his/her desk. Only a regular torch or flashlight is used to look inside the ears. The ENT specialist is the one to see if you wish to have an otoscope used.
