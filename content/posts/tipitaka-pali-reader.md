## What is new?

**Build 85+ Release** — May 2025 for Linux AppImage, Android, and Windows:

This release includes AI integration. You will need an AI API key from {{< extlink "https://openrouter.ai/" "OpenRouter" >}}, but you can get one without a credit card and use the free API engines, which work reasonably well. However, GPT-4o or GPT-4.1 offer better performance.

Simply add the key in the settings and save it. Then, go to the book, highlight some text, right-click (or long-press), and select **AI Context**. This will send a request to OpenRouter with the selected text and chosen prompt.

You can also temporarily modify the prompts. The feature works with multiple languages and scripts out of the box.



## Purpose of Application:

This app is useful for reading Pāḷi texts. It is similar to [TPP](https://americanmonk.org/tipitaka-pali-projector/). Total feature migration is planned in the future. If you read pāḷi and use a reading app, you will most likely prefer this as your pāḷi reading app on the phone or desktop. However, at the moment some features are better in TPP.

## Typing Roman Letters:

Typing in Roman script has full integration with the velthuis ascii typing system which is now a standard in pali. The keyboard chart can be found on this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velthuis)

## Dictionary:

The dictionary and reading experience is where TPR shines the most. We have included [Digital Pāḷi Dictionary](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/) and Pāḷi English Ultimate dictionaries as part of the standard installed dictionaries. Soon you will be able to download more.
