## Purpose of Application:

  
This app is useful for reading Pāḷi texts. It is similar to [TPP](https://americanmonk.org/tipitaka-pali-projector/). Total feature migration is planned in the future. If you read pāḷi and use a reading app, you will most likely prefer this as your pāḷi reading app on the phone or desktop. However, at the moment some features are better in TPP.

## Typing Roman Letters:

Typing in Roman script has full integration with the velthuis ascii typing system which is now a standard in pali. The keyboard chart can be found on this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velthuis)

## Dictionary:

The dictionary and reading experience is where TPR shines the most. We have included [Digital Pāḷi Dictionary](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/) and Pāḷi English Ultimate dictionaries as part of the standard installed dictionaries. Soon you will be able to download more.
