## Is It a Blessing From God?
When a donor gives out of faith and respect, these words remind both giver and receiver that wholesome actions bear wholesome results. There is only *kamma* in Buddhism—no magic. However, when one pays attention to the laws of cause and effect while making a donation (an act of reverence and *kamma*), wisdom is added to the cause-and-effect process. The results will then have three roots instead of two: non-greed, non-anger, and wisdom.

While the chant is related to reverence, reverence itself is closely associated with the act of giving dāna (the offering of food). Can you see how the qualities of respectfully eating food that was given to the monks yield long life, beauty, happiness, and strength? Of course you can. In the West, we have a famous saying:  
> What comes around goes around  

With that, we naturally know that when you give these qualities with a faithful mind, you will receive these qualities back. That is why the donor gains these blessings. When focusing on cause and effect, wisdom will also be added to the donor’s mind.

Therefore, the monk who practices humility and respect gains these four qualities while eating the donation, and through the act of respectful generosity in offering a meal, the donor receives the same blessings in return.

**May this help you realize Nibbāna safely and quickly.**
