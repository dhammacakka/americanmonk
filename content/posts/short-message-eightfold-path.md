Many people think that the **Noble Eightfold Path** (*Ariya Aṭṭhaṅgika Magga*) and the **Four Noble Truths** (*Cattāri Ariya Saccāni*) are different.  
However, the Noble Eightfold Path is actually the **Fourth Noble Truth** (*Magga Sacca*) among the Four Noble Truths.

## The Four Noble Truths

1. **Dukkha Sacca** — The Truth of Suffering  
2. **Samudaya Sacca** — The Truth of the Cause of Suffering  
3. **Nirodha Sacca** — The Truth of the Ending of Suffering  
4. **Magga Sacca** — The Truth of the Way Leading Out of Suffering (*The Noble Eightfold Path*)  

## Summary Poem
> Some think the Truths and the Path are not the same,  
> Because they don't know all four by each name.  
> Suffering is the first, while the cause is number two,  
> The third is its ending, the fourth — a Path to do.
