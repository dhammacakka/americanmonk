**Kitchen for 1,000 to 2,000 Residents Overview**  
A layperson and myself took a trip to the lower monastery to take some pictures of the kitchen process.  
I will be sharing several posts from time to time featuring this kitchen experience which was amazing, at least in person.  
The central wood fired oven stove (yes, that's right, wood) is seen in this picture. Another stove on the side was in operation too.  
There is another separate room which steams rice with four custom made steamers and steaming racks. All powered by wood and sawdust.  
Lastly, the central stainless steel table for prep work is shown in this picture.  
Some nun's work in the kitchen, but most nuns and laywomen are free to meditate as much as they wish. The workers in the kitchen are paid staff and volunteers as well.  
This is just one picture from my tablet. Most pictures were taken by a layperson in still and or video with a high quality camera.
