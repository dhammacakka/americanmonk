[![IMG_20151028_112524](/images/IMG_20151028_112524.jpg)](/images/2015/10/IMG_20151028_112524.jpg) Yesterday, we got some pre-Halloween candy during our alms round at one of the houses. I thought that was very "sweet" of our donor.

Halloween is a holiday on October 31, in America where kids dress up as, well, anything they want. They go around the neighborhood at night and ring the doorbells and say "Trick or treat!". Then the person at the house would place some candy inside the ambitiously sized candy collection bags.
