## What Is the Buddhist Rainy Season?
**Understanding the Vassa and Kaṭhina Ceremonies**

Each year, Theravāda Buddhist monks all over the world make a determination to stay in a single monastery for a three month period of the Rainy Season also known as **Vassa**, or the **Rains Retreat**.  You will hear the term "Vassa" often in this article, so please remember it.  Traditionally, it starts *the day after* the Full Moon Day in July or *the day after* the Āsāḷha full moon known in the Pāḷi language.  If your monks move around a lot and you need to rely on a teacher, you can expect the monks to stay at a monastery for a full three months without moving around.  Some make determinations to practice harder, while others who already follow a steady practice simply continue their daily routine as usual. In this article, we will look at the origins of Vassa, the different types of Vassas, the allowances to leave the vassa on business, or by emergencies, if it affects the age of a monk, and what happens at the end of Vassa.

### The Origins of Vassa

During the Buddha’s time, monks wandered on foot to different monasteries, forests and villages.  They would wander during all times of the year, even during the seasonal rains.  However, laypeople—especially farmers—began to complain:

>“How can the Sakyan monastics go wandering in the winter, in the summer, and even during the rainy season? They’re trampling down the green grass, oppressing one-sensed life, and destroying many small creatures. Even the monastics of other religions, with their flawed teachings, settle down for the rainy season. Even birds make a nest in the top of a tree and settle down for the rainy-season. But not so the Sakyan monastics.”

Out of compassion and to match the culture of the time, The Buddha responded with a new instruction:

> **“Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, vassaṁ upagantun”ti.**<BR>   
> “I allow you, monks, to enter the rains residence.”*

This rule brought the monks the Rains Retreat period of three months that met the expectations of the lay communities during the time of The Buddha, but also inspires practice and striving by monks for generations all the way to the present.  Lastly, it inspires the lay people in the present as well.



### Two Kinds of Vassa

The Buddha allowed for **two entry points** into the rains residence:


>**“Dvemā, bhikkhave, vassūpanāyikā: purimikā ca pacchimikā ca.”**
>
>“There are two entries: the earlier and the later.”

- **Purimikā** (first vassa) begins the day after the Āsāḷha full moon.
- **Pacchimikā** (second vassa) begins one month later.  Sometimes refered to as "Second vassa."

This allowance for two vassas shows the Buddha’s practical wisdom and compassion because not everything goes right the first time as we will discuss later.  It should be noted that the determination to stay in the monastery for three months is actually the day after the Full Moon Day.  This is when the new month starts.  Although most monasteries have the Vassa ceremony on the Full Moon Day and it is a time for a large gathering, that is just for lay people because they have that day off.  We really make the official determination the next day.  Most of the lay people will probably never know it really happens on the next day.

### Leaving During Vassa: Seven-Day Business Rule

Monks are expected to remain in their vassa location for the full three months. However, issues came up where the monks needed to leave.  The Buddha allowed what is called, 
"Sattāhakaraṇīya" or “Seven-day business”

Some of the many valid reasons include:

- Being called by a bhikkhu, sāmaṇera, or layperson (to teach Dhamma)
- Caring for a sick parent
- Handling urgent Saṅgha matters such as settling communal disputes or preventing a monk disrobing during times of difficulty.

The Vinaya allows a monk to leave temporarily for "valid reasons" with the requirement that:

- The monk must declare the intention to return.
- He must return within 7 nights.


### Leaving Vassa Without Offense

Sometimes, a monk may leave permanently **without offense**, such as in these situations:

- Danger from wild animals, robbers, or even supernatural threats
- Floods, fire, lack of requisites
- Temptations or ethical risks (e.g. being offered wealth or marriage)
- Preventing or resolving Saṅgha schism

In this way, The Buddha was firm in discipline of making a strong determination to stay put, but also compassionate with exceptions for certain situations that might arise.

### Does Missing Vassa Affect Monk Age?
A monk might just break his determination for no proper reason.  He incurs an offense of wrong doing, but some might ask if "breaking the vassa" affects one’s monk age or seniority. The answer is: **No**.

Although we say "This monk has completed 10 Rainy Seasons," or "This monk is 10 vassā", the monastic age is based on one's ordination date, not how many vassas one has completed.  I wrote an article that talks about {{< extlink "https://americanmonk.org/the-order-of-monks-how-seniority-shapes-the-buddhist-monastic-life/" "Order of Monks" >}}. Ordination literally means when you enter the "Order".


### The Kaṭhina Robe Ceremony

After vassa ends with the **Pavāraṇā** ceremony, the **Kaṭhina** robe offering takes place:

- At least five monks must have completed vassa together.
- A lay donor offers robe cloth.
- The Saṅgha selects a monk to receive and spread the robe.


> Anujānāmi, bhikkhave, pañcannaṁ saṅghe pavāretun”ti
>
>“When there are five of you, you should do the invitation ceremony in the Sangha.”

Sometimes I see Kaṭhina ceremonies for monasteries with only one or two monks.  Culturally in spirit, it might be a "Kaṭhina," but not really so in the technical sense.  After the Kaṭhina ceremony is spread, the monks who successfully finished the Rains Retreat determination get Kaṭhina privileges for five months.  After the rainy season ends, the monks may now wander and travel as they did before, or they may continue to stay at the same location.


### Conclusion

Vassa isn’t just a tradition, it’s a serious season for focused practice. It respects the original wishes from the lay supporters, but it is also a time for a retreat and a time for practice.  Meditation Centers that maintain schedules all year round will not be much different during this time, but even so, monks will still make a stronger effort during this time.

## Summary Poem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rains arrive and skies are gray,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monks determine the three-month stay.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stay in place, their path made clear,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And getting older year by year.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two times are allowed to make the start,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one to shift, it’s a reason of heart.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may leave briefly, if duty calls,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Dhamma’s sake or preventing falls.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When vassa ends, the cloth is spread,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel may begin, as The Buddha said.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A season rich with calm and grace,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A time to strive or keep the pace.
