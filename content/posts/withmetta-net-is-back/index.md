**Withmetta.net is back** with a new interface! Only two stories left and I wrote one of those two! Here is a simple story about giving. I encourage you to write many stories. There is no limit and they can be simple in content or length. As you wish. [http://withmetta.net/wide-and-shining-eyes](http://withmetta.net/wide-and-shining-eyes)ï»¿

[Wide And Shining Eyes | With Metta](http://withmetta.net/wide-and-shining-eyes/)

Wide And Shining Eyes. It was in 2011 when I came with my ex-wife to Myanmar. In Yangon, there are many begging children that sell postcards on the streets and near the tourist areas. Knowing this beforehand, I used to carry some sweets with me to give them instead of money.
