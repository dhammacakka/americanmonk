This non-legged creature was found in my kuti.  The picture was shot from my bed about 6 feet away.  As you can see, he came from the widely spaced floorboards.  Sorry about the photo quality,  I might have been shaking.  One time when I described a craite snake (found inches from my bed) to Venerable Pa Auk Sayadaw, he said to me, "Don't worry.  It's not dangerous but VERY poisonous."  He meant it won't chase you.  Snakes are usually slow moving, or at least the ones I live to tell about.﻿
