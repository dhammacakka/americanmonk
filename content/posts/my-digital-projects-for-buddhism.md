## Introduction 

In this post, I introduce some of the key digital projects I’ve been working on to support the study, practice, and expansion of Orthodox Theravāda Buddhism. These tools are designed to make Pāḷi texts more accessible, enhance Buddhist study, and provide practical applications for practicing Buddhist teachings through technology. Read on to learn more about each project, and watch the video at the end of this post for a full overview.  The video is a boring zoom presentation with screen shares, but it does the job.  A list of the projects is found below:

- Discontinued.

TPP was my first shot at managing digital projects.  It was used for navigating the Pāḷi texts and is now replaced with TPR (Tipitaka Pāḷi Reader).  TPP is now an unsupported tool for navigating the Pāḷi Canon, but it is still available on the Ubuntu Snap Store and the Microsoft Application Store.
