Recently, I made a video explaining the common question I get asked in the West.  "Do you believe in a creator?"  It is a loaded question usually asked by devoted Christians.  They are expecting me to say no, but I tell them "Yes".  The real answer is that kamma is the creator. 

I quote from the stock phrase below:
> **“Kammassakomhi, kammadāyādo, kammayoni,**  
> *“It is actions that I own, it is actions that I am heir to, it is actions that I am born from,*  
>  
> **kammabandhu, kammapaṭisaraṇo -**  
> *Actions are my kinsfolk, actions are my refuge -*  
>  
> **yaṁ kammaṁ karissāmi, kalyāṇaṁ vā pāpakaṁ vā,**  
> *Whatever actions I perform, whether good or bad,*  
>  
> **tassa dāyādo bhavissāmī” ti,**  
> *To that I will be the heir”,*  
>  
> **pabbajitena abhiṇhaṁ paccavekkhitabbaṁ.**  
> *One who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this.*
