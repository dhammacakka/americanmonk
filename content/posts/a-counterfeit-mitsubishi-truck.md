From my oldest posts from GPlus in 2015, which are slowly being restored.

A Counterfeit Mitsubishi Truck was found in Pa-Auk Forest Monastery. I had my doubts, so I asked the driver to open up the hood. It was in fact, a Toyota engine block. Consumers, please be careful!  

In the olden days there were very high taxes on cars. I think 200% tax which made used cars hold their value well. To avoid import taxes, it was common to make a village car. Here is the post I made.
