My friend scheduled another interview with me and recently published it.

The video discusses why should monks not touch money? Is there an exchange that takes place with the things you receive?

The video includes stories on how alms works, the blessings that I give and how people benefit by giving. One story recounts how I went for alms close to the time where we cannot eat and how generous and beautiful the Myanmar people can be. Another story explains how a lady cried after I gave a blessing. The last story talks about some rubber tree workers who fed me daily for about a month in 2007.
