A 2 part Powerpoint presentation about what two monks did in Kauai, Hawaii during June to December 2015. The theme was propagation, but the propagation was done just from being monks who do not touch money, and collect their food the traditional Buddhist monk way. The vision, how it got started, stories and experiences were shared.  About 50 people were in the audience.  Running time is about 1 hour total for both.  There is a comment added at the end of part two so make sure you do not quite when it seems like it is over.
