On December 14th I returned to paauk main Mawlamyine.  
There was a Hawaiian drink on the day I arrived; Noni.  In Hawaii, this fruit, by the same name, is known as, "Even if there is a famine..."  If you know the fruit, you will know the rest of the quote.  Never the less, it is good medicine and there is no grey area for monks to push for this one.  It is medicine and you will know it when you taste it.   When you drink it, you will notice it is slightly (not much more) easier to get down the hatch as urine.  If that last sentence seems like a tall tale, google "Urine Therapy."﻿
