A monk practices by rote memory in the learning hall. I call it "The Shouting Room"  
Take a listen to what the room sounds like. Here... [https://archive.org/details/tmp\_3492-TheShoutingRoom-1064581155](https://archive.org/details/tmp_3492-TheShoutingRoom-1064581155)  
  
I have tried practicing in this room. It his quite intense and yes...probably better progress than doing it quietly alone.﻿  
Ps. That is just a water bottle..not soda!﻿
