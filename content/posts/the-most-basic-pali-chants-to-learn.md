There are many different Pāḷi chants to learn, yet I wanted to list the absolute basic chants that one should learn. If you are interested in Pāḷi chanting, these are the first to learn. The most basic and essential chants for beginning lay people should know are listed in order of importance:

1. **Namo Tassa,**
2. **Triple Gem with the 5 precepts,**
3. **Bare bones Triple Gem chant of the 24 qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha.**
4. **[Loving-Kindness sutta](#lovingkindness)**

## Namo Tassa

Before any chanting or dhamma discourse, the monk and the group will chant "Namo tassa" together as a group. It is one line repeated 3 times and easy to remember.

**Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa**  
Reverence to him, the Fortunate One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha

**Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa**  
Reverence to him, the Fortunate One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha

**Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa**  
Reverence to him, the Fortunate One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha

## Taking Refuge In Triple Gem

**Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa x 3**  
Reverence to him, the Fortunate One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha

with the five precepts. Please, Bhante, kindly administer

[right click to download mp3](https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Audio/Safeguard-Recitals/00-Mahaparittam-05.mp3)

**Karaṇīyam-atthakusalena, yan-taṁ santaṁ padaṁ abhisamecca:**  
What should be done by one skilled in goodness, who has comprehended the state of peace:

**sakko ujū ca sūjū ca, suvaco cassa mudu anatimānī, \[01\]**  
he ought to be able, straight, and upright, easy to speak to, meek, without conceit,

**santussako ca subharo ca, appakicco ca sallahukavutti,**  
satisfied (with little), easy to support, free from duties, and light in living,

**santindriyo ca nipako ca, appagabbho kulesu ananugiddho, \[02\]**  
with faculties at peace, prudent, not forward, and greedless among the families,

**na ca khuddaṁ samācare kiñci yena viññū pare upavadeyyuṁ.**  
he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault (with him).

**“Sukhino vā khemino hontu, sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhitattā! \[03\]**  
“(May all beings) be happy and secure, may all beings in their hearts be happy!

**Ye keci pāṇabhūtatthi tasā vā thāvarā vā anavasesā,**  
Whatsoever breathing beings there are trembling, firm, or any other (beings),

**dīghā vā ye mahantā vā, majjhimā rassakāṇukathūlā, \[04\]**  
whether they be long or great, of middle (size), short, tiny, or of compact (body),

**diṭṭhā vā ye ca addiṭṭhā, ye ca dūre vasanti avidūre,**  
those who are seen, and those who are unseen, those who live far away, those who are near,

**bhūtā vā sambhavesī vā sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhitattā!” \[05\]**  
those who are born, and those who still seek birth may all beings in their hearts be happy!”

**Na paro paraṁ nikubbetha, nātimaññetha katthaci naṁ kañci,**  
No one should cheat another, nor should he despise anyone wherever he is,

**byārosanā paṭighasaññā nāññam-aññassa dukkham-iccheyya. \[06\]**  
he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment.

**Mātā yathā niyaṁ puttaṁ āyusā ekaputtam-anurakkhe,**  
In the same way as a mother would protect her child, her only child, with her life,

**evam-pi sabbabhūtesu mānasaṁ bhāvaye aparimāṇaṁ. \[07\]**  
so too towards all beings one should develop the measureless thought (of friendliness).

**Mettañ-ca sabbalokasmiṁ mānasaṁ bhāvaye aparimāṇaṁ,**  
Towards the entire world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness,

**uddhaṁ adho ca tiriyañ-ca, asambādhaṁ averaṁ asapattaṁ. \[08\]**  
above, below, and across (the middle), without barriers, hate, or enmity.

**Tiṭṭhaṁ caraṁ nisinno vā, sayāno vā yāvatassa vigatamiddho,**  
Standing, walking, sitting, lying, for as long as he is without torpor,

**etaṁ satiṁ adhiṭṭheyya, brahmam-etaṁ vihāraṁ idha-m-āhu. \[09\]**  
he should be resolved on this mindfulness, for this, they say here, is the (true) spiritual life.

**Diṭṭhiñ-ca anupagamma, sīlavā dassanena sampanno,**  
Without going near a (wrong) view, virtuous, and endowed with (true) insight,

**kāmesu vineyya gedhaṁ, na hi jātu gabbhaseyyaṁ punar-etī ti. \[10\]**  
having removed greed towards sense pleasures, he does not come to lie in a womb again.
