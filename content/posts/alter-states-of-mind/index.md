**Alter States of Mind**  
♥♥♥  
If you look at the center of the picture, you will see a transparent pink heart!  
I did not notice this until I prepared this post. Very cool!

This was going to be the post below:  
**Alter States of Mind**  
Chanting and setting up my alter is a good excuse to be beautiful. Beautiful is a group of mental ingredients (sobhanacetasika) contained in every wholesome mind. Sitting on the floor, I was just appreciating what I have, and I thought I would take a picture to show that moment.  
An Alter State of Mind.  
  
  
No editing:  
Other than the words pasted on the bottom, and the KB size reduction, nothing has changed from the original photo. It is probably caused by the candles and the settings on my tablet/camera, but I'd like to believe it was a Kodak moment.♥
