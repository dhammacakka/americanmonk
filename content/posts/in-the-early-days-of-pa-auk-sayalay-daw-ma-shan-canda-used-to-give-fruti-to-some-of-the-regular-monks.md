In the early days of Pa-Auk, Sayalay Daw Ma (Shan) Canda used to give fruti to some of the regular monks when it was difficult to come by without private supporters.  Nearly every day, she was seen helping out in the almsfood line.  She had medical problems, but it was difficult to know by her cheerful attitude and success in meditation.  She died about a year ago.   The packets still continue and eventually the name on the packages changed to the living Sayalay Yathawati (Rasavati) who manages the dana in her memory.﻿
