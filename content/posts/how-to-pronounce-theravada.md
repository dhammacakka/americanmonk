# How to Pronounce Theravāda

Have you ever wondered if you were pronouncing **Theravāda** correctly? Read this article to find out how to properly pronounce it.

Most resources on the web mispronounce *Theravāda*, and even Google failed me when I searched. The “Th” sound is **not** like the English “them” or “think.” It is simply a **T with a puff of air**—an aspirated T. If that sounds complicated, don’t worry. Many Americans already aspirate their T’s naturally. Begin the word with a crisp “T” and you’ll do better than most.

To confuse you further, the **V** often leans toward a soft **W** sound, something between the two. Many Southeast Asian countries even transliterate it with a W.

You’ll also notice the diacritical mark on the final vowel. That ā is longer—two beats in meter. All Pāḷi vowels are Latin-style vowels:  
- **A** sounds like *ah*  
- **E** sounds like *hey*  
And **E** also gets two beats.

In meter, it looks like this:

> **−⏑−⏑**

So you would pronounce it: **Te-Rah-Waah-Dah**.  
In Sri Lanka, the final “a” becomes more like “uh,” as in “duh,” so you get: **Te-Rah-Waah-Duh**.

If you want to be really cool, you can add the slight puff of air on the first T—almost like an elegant lady gently aspirating the sound:

> “T-he-Rah-Waah-Duh”

Below is a recording by Venerable Anandajoti, who pronounces the V stronger than I do—likely because I spent more than 10 years in Myanmar.
