This is a picture of today's Alms round at the villages surrounding Varanasi Monastery. The rice is put into the bowls and the curries are collected separately by the helpers or our young monks. The meals are given to the monks using this food and other supplementary food. It is a Buddhist tradition still active in Myanmar and also a way to support ourselves.ï»¿
