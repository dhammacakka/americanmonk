I went to Waimea canyon today. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea\_Canyon\_State\_Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea_Canyon_State_Park) I think it was the most beautiful place I had ever seen or tied to seeing the whales jumping out of the ocean at the 8 mile cliff campsite from the kalalau trail fifteen years ago. All that said, they are both found on Kauai. The pictures are great, but disappointingly flat. The last picture was Polihale beach.
