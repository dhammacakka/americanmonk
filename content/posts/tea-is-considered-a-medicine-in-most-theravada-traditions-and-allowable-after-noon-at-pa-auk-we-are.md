Tea is considered a medicine in most Theravada traditions and allowable after NOON.  At Pa Auk, we are NOT allowed tea after NOON because "medicines" should be for medical purposes.  Green tea is often pickled and served with meals, called lapet.   In contrast, fresh juice drinks are allowable after NOON for a single evening in all Theravada traditions.  Yesterday was fresh squeezed (and chilled) sugar cane juice. "If god gives you lemons, make lemonade."  Sometimes that comes on other days.  
Note: The bottles are recycled.  
2nd note:  Notice the stray dogs in the road.  I estimate about 50-80 canine residents.  Dogs can survive very well on vegetarian people food.  People can survive very well on vegetarian people food too :)﻿
