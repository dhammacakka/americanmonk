There are three stories of loving-kindness told in the video posted below. The first story is from Kaua'i, Hawai'i, when a person did not want me on "his" street. Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed. Another story was also from the island in 2015. There were children on bicycles who were yelling at us to go away on multiple days. Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed. The last story is from 2011 during a trip to India. The loving-kindness did not change the other, but a different outcome was the result.

The lady probably did not say, "If you have Jesus in your heart, then you do not need to collect food." I might be confusing it with another story from 2006 when I was going for alms in New Britain, CT where this lady definitely said that quote. Perhaps this will be an excuse to tell that story later. This story is told in my book: [Going For Broke: Travelogs On Becoming A Buddhist Monk.](https://americanmonk.org/book-going-for-broke/)

I was inspired by this method of piṇḍapāta in the USA because the original arahant disciple Subhūti Mahathero used to go into loving-kindness absorption concentration before receiving food from each donor.

The first story about the the man who did not like me being on his street is on my blog under the title [Fighting Anger With Loving-Kindness and No Money](https://americanmonk.org/fighting-anger-with-loving-kindness/)
