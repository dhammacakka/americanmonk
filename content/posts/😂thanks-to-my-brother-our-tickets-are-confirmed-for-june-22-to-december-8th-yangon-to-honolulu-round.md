????Thanks to my brother, our tickets are confirmed for June 22 to December 8th Yangon to Honolulu round trip. Amazing price at $852. 
Then we fly to Kauai the same day. Getting to hnl will take 33 hours, with two stops in China. My kind brother told me to give him three itineraries so I would not feel worried about the price, but I only gave him one.  
Ven Devananda, my monastic companion, is now the holder of a multi entry USA visa valid until 2020! However, he will probably only be able to do one entry. Unfortunately, in order to get a visa, you need to be a busy person who will not stay long in the usa. He will continue at ITBMU for his Masters Degree for 4 years starting in June, 2016. This was a key point for his visa acceptance. He got perfect marks on his past exams. Getting that visa took a great deal of work to put together 47 pages of supporting information from many different participants and two DHL deliveries. I am very grateful for this effort and result. The info packet turned out really nice and you did not need to read it to know it was a valid applicant. However, I was still nervous about the results since it was a private sponsorship. This is my 6th successful Western country visa packet I worked on for monks.ï»¿
