I saw a newly ordained bhikkhu near the "Pre-leftovers" table. I asked him how he was doing and he said to me. "I am doing much better mentally, physically and energetically. No attainments for what I originally came here for, but things are good."  
I told him, "You can be happy just radiating Loving-kindness all of the time. It will help with your meditation, but if you do not get any attainments, you still win.". He smiled, asked me how I was and then we parted just before another heavy rain settled in.
