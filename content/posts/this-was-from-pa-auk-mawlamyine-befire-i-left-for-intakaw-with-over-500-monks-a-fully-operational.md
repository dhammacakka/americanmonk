This was from Pa Auk Mawlamyine befire I left for Intakaw. With over 500 monks, a fully operational clinic is possible.  Western Medicine Doctors come twice per week.  A Dental Surgeon two or three times per week.  And of course, Local Myanmar Medicine one day per week.  Most medicine is usually donated an available "in-house."  Malaria testing is available "in-house" too.  Much has changed since 2001!  Sadhu!﻿
