This video is an instruction on how to practice loving-kindness meditation. The simplest way is to repeat the Loving-Kindness phrases (mantras). The discussion goes into the details. I hope you enjoy this.

May you be happy!

May you be happy!

May you be happy!

Repeat "May **I** be happy" over and over again (in your mind) until the timer goes off.

Repeat "May **you** be happy" over and over again (in your mind) until the timer goes off.

Put your phone on **airplane mode**, but use your phone to set your timer for 5 minutes to start. Gradually increase it to 10 or 20 or 30 minutes. Maybe even one hour. But do whatever you can everyday. If you can only do a short time, but you can do it everyday, then this is the best time for you.
