In America, the [Rote Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning) of learning is belittled as "learning like a parrot" and rarely or never taught in the Western school systems. However, it is a useful brute force method for memorizing Pali texts and the only way to memorize longer word for word Pāḷi texts such as the Pātimokkha. This system is used extensively in Myanmar schools and Myanmar study monasteries. If you hear lots of noise in the classrooms, rote learning is what they are doing. This video explains both passive and aggressive Rote Methods for memorizing Pāḷi. May you be successful in your learning and practice!
