The Pali Text Society has made its Vinaya, Sutta and Abhidhamma books available for non-commercial use since 2013. The Sutta books have been extracted from the [Buddhadust Website](http://buddhadust.net/backmatter/indexes/sutta/sutta_toc.htm) which is still considered as "work in progress." However, the work was good enough to reformat as eBooks in its current state.

Stephen Torrence and myself did most of the work to reformat the web pages into eBook versions. There were thousands of webpages which required many scripts to remove the web content. We used the open source project called Sigil.

What is special about these books? These are the unabridged editions of the original PTS Sutta books which were some of the first translations which have been referenced by several modern translators who followed later. Unabridged means the triple dots which used to represent missing repetitions have been expanded or "rolled out" with those missing repetitions. It is cost effective for electronic editions and some people swear that something is "lost" in translation with these repetitions represented by the triple dots (...). The texts have been formatted on the Buddhadust website in a nice grouped poetic way which helps a great deal with sorting through all of the information while reading. Lastly, since these books are quite old, they were written in an older English religious style, your vocabulary could use a little brush up!

Click the format (PDF, ePub, Mobi, AZW3) under the book you'd like to download it to your device.
