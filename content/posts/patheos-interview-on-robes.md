A couple of months ago, I was contacted by a professor of World Religions in the College of Religious Education at BYU named, [Alonzo Gaskill.](https://religion.byu.edu/directory/alonzo-gaskill) He had read my previous article on [Buddhist Monk's Robes Information](https://americanmonk.org/buddhist-monks-robes-information/) and wanted to interview me for another Buddhist robes article for [Patheos.com](https://www.patheos.com/religion-behind-the-scenes/how-are-buddhist-monastic-robes-made-and-used). We talked for quite a long time about Buddhism, my past, and why I ordained, and then the time was up. So we scheduled another call to talk about robes the next day to actually talk about the robes. The credits at the end of the article say "Interview conducted, transcribed, edited, and condensed by Alonzo L. Gaskill. Well, he certainly did condense the 3+ hours of interview time, but I think he did a great job at getting the key points.

I had fun during the interview and also reading the finished product after it was finished. I hope you enjoy the article too.
