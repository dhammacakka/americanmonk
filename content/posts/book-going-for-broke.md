_Going For Broke: Travelogs On Becoming a Buddhist Monk_ is a compilation of travel stories.  It is an anonymously written book about a lay person who quit his job in order to travel the world and then become a Buddhist Monk.  Most people either love it and read it in a few days or never finish it.

Here is the back cover:

> "Going for Broke" consists of travel stories written by a young American man who gave up his lucrative job to travel the world and decide if he would fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a Buddhist monk.

> "At age 28, when an ethical problem arose at work, the author gave up his lucrative computer career to travel the world and decide whether to renounce it and become a Buddhist monk as he long dreamed. "Going for Broke" consists of travel stories and reflections sent to a growing list of friends as he traveled to Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, India, Nepal, Thailand and Myanmar. In a magical moment on the shore of an island, he makes a discovery that convinces him of his destiny. He goes on to ordain as a Theravada monk, gambling the stable life he had for enlightenment-- literally "Going for Broke." The book describes in detail his life as a monk, thoughts on meditation, and a return trip to visit his family in the United States for the first time wearing his monk's robes."
