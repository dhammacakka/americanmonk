**The Old Fashion Fire-Line Method**  
Without a concrete truck, you need many volunteers to work in a concrete fire-line to pour concrete. Bucket by bucket, the task gets completed. I have never seen or heard of any other method used for any of the buildings at Pa-auk. This project is for Sayadawkyi's new meeting room which will be attached to his newest kuti at Pa-Auk Tawya. His first kuti, made from bamboo has been torn down and replaced with a new three story 80 room dormitory. Sayadawkyi is expected to come to Pa-Auk Main in May and they have night crews working to finish it before he arrives. The donor does not expect the hall to get used often, and it might only get used only for a few days or weeks by Sayadawkyi. That will be enough for the donor's satisfaction; a different mindset from the West.
