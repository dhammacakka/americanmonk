Here is a picture of a temporary novice monk (_Samanera_) from Scotland at our roadside _Bodhi Tree_. Pa-Auk is one of the few places in the world that follows the vinaya (code of rules) that will ordain foreigners for a short period of time without any commitment. It is part of the Myanmar Monastic Culture. When local people come for a retreat, quite often, they ordain as full monks (_Bhikkhus_) for that time. Sometimes, meditation goes well or something else becomes desirable for them to stay in robes...and they do. One monk named U Dhammapala made it 13 years from from his initial 45 day retreat. He later went to teach _The Pa-Auk Method_ in Vietnam and then eventually disrobed last year. Currently, there are more than 80 Vietnamese residents at Pa-Auk which may be a result of this effort. Another friend of mind also did a 45 day retreat. He was a doctor before and now he appears to be training to become a meditation teacher. He is now on his third year. Once a full monk (_Bhikkhu_), he can stay in robes for as long as he wishes and nobody can force him to disrobe as long as he does not _defeat_ himself.
