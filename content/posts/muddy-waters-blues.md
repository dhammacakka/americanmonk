**Muddy Waters Blues**  
Every so often the water tank on the mountain goes empty and the water looks like this!  
It is only iron oxide but it is a bit freaky especially when it is black color, which it was for a short time. I tried to capture the black, but I was a little late.:-)  
Maymyo area has calcium carbonate in its water.  
Nauyana, Sri Lanka has a mountain water spring....ahhh!
