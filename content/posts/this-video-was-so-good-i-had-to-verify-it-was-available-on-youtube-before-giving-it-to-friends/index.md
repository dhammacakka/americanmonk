**This video was so good, I had to verify it was available on youtube before giving it to friends**  
A friend came here with this video predownloaded (as most downloads in Myanmar, with our connection speeds). It is absolutely one of the best videos on Myanmar, but only three minutes and forty-five seconds long :(  
It is amazing what people can do these days and it feels so 3D too.  
  
Please Note: Fishing is considered unwholesome and wrong livelihood in Buddhism.
