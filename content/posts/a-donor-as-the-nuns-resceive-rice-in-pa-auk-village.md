**A donor as the nuns resceive rice in Pa-Auk Village**  
A few times per year, as part of a tradition, the whole monastery goes to the village to collect raw rice. The monks are assisted by school children who act as helpers since monks are not allowed to touch food that will be used for a later date. The nuns are allowed to collect rice directly. The rice is later relinquished to the monastery.
