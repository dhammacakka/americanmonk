I just recieved a box of goodies from Thailand for the FM translation system.  It has a new fm mic for our translation system along with 15 adapters and 10 extra headphones.  The adapters will allow one radio to support two sets of headphones.   The new microphone has a range of over 100 feet (200 ft circle).  I get so happy every time there is a translated talk!﻿
