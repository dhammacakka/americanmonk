I am feeling really happy..like my feet are not really touching the ground today!  
My dream to be a monk and live in Hawaii, which specifically changed to Kauai, that started in 1999 might come true. I got the green light for air tickets and other things. I just need to get the visa for my Sri Lankan monastic friend who agreed to come. If this visa gets approved, I will be even more happy! So far three steps considered "impossible" have been cleared. Step by step one more to go. He has been to Australia and I did that visa application for him, so odds are not as bad, but still difficult.  
No, I will not go alone. So if the visa fails, or I cannot find another monk to come with me, the whole thing gets cancelled.  
I will go to Yangon quite soon to start arrangements.????ï»¿
