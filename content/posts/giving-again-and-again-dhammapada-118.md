Below are two talks based on the Dhammapada verses 49 and 118

The verses 

> **49 yathāpi bhamaro pupphaṃ,**  
> **vaṇṇagandhamaheṭhayaṃ,**  
> **paleti rasamādāya,**  
> **evaṃ gāme munī care.**
> 
> As a bee gathers honey from the flower  
> without injuring its color or fragrance,  
> even so does the sage go on his alms-round in the village. 
> 
> **118 puññañce puriso kayirā,**  
> **kayirā naṃ punappunaṃ,**  
> **tamhi chandaṃ kayirātha,**  
> **sukho puññassa uccayo.**
> 
> Should a person do good,  
> let him do it again and again.  
> let him find pleasure there,  
> for being blissful is the accumulation of good.


In the first video I talk about how I was careful to get my food from the village without disturbing it.  It was by changing roads that I met Koral and her parents.  I wrote about her in the post called, {{< extlink "https://americanmonk.org/koral-inspires-me" "Koral Inspires me" >}}

Afterwards, I tell another story which is not written down elsewhere when, I was picked up by a stranger who wanted to know what I was doing in front of the houses.  He was very kind to me and appreciated what I was doing.

The Next video is related to the same verse 118 only.

> **118 puññañce puriso kayirā,**  
> **kayirā naṃ punappunaṃ,**  
> **tamhi chandaṃ kayirātha,**  
> **sukho puññassa uccayo.**
> 
> Should a person do good,  
> let him do it again and again.  
> let him find pleasure there,  
> for being blissful is the accumulation of good.


I speak about how a lady donated me a shoulder bag so that I could carry the food that does not fit into my bowl into the monastery.  After looking at it closely, I noticed it was made by her.  It was very touching.  It reminded me of a story from when I was going for alms in 2007 through the rubber tree forest, near Pa-Auk Forest Monastery, Mawlamyine.  I had three curry cups, but the ladies in the forest wanted me to have more than 3 curries.  They donated more cups in order to donate more food.  In this video, I explain the full story and also the touching event that happened when during our last goodbye.  I briefly write about this in a post called: {{< extlink "https://americanmonk.org/intelligent-donations-turning-the-tables/" "Intelligent Donations: Turning The Tables" >}}
