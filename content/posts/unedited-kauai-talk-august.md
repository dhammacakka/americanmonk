Here is an unedited file from the dhamma talk I gave.  The first section on Loving kindness is missing. Soon I will add the first talk which has a similar first section.

The two hours consists of:  
Chanting and loving kindness meditation   
5 minute break  
An introduction and general overview of the Sabbasava Sutta.  
5 minute break  
A brief meditation session, followed by Q/A and sharing of merit.

The talk can be downloaded [Here](https://archive.org/details/Kauaidhammatalk).
