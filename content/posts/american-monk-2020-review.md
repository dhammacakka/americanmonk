This past year has been very fruitful for AmericanMonk.org. In this post, we will discuss the 2020 page view stats. Originally, the name of the website was subhuti.withmetta.net but can you remember that website url? Trying to think of an easy meaningful and descriptive name for Westerners to remember was not easy, but AmericanMonk.org was available and I took it.

So how did things go in the year 2020? Below is a chart of the years up to today.

Yearly Page Hits up to 2020

Not so bad. As you can see the yearly hits total was about 46,000 and the visitor rank was 22,000. That is a filtered WordPress visitor and page hit list which excludes robots. This year showed a lot of growth and it also shows that if you just keep writing and doing what you like to do, people will come and things will steadily grow over time.

The CPanel chart below shows different numbers. CPanel is the server interface which is a level up from the web management software I use and showed above. The people who know more about websites than me claim that these are also free from counting robots and more accurate than the one shown above.

2020 stats from CPanel. The bottom row shows the totals for the year.

Here you will see that the server counting totals (cpanel) shows 45,000 unique visitors and nearly a half million page hits...wow!

Below, back to the WordPress stats, is a summary of the page hits.

WordPress page stats 2020

The thing that tipped the scales this year was the free pts ebooks project which was released in the end of 2019, which gave an astounding 10,000 hits this year alone. From there, people got curious and started browsing the website. Some liked the website during an investigative stroll and started reading more while others did not go much further than the home page. It is always fun to see 50 or a hundred pages marked with single page reads. That means that a single person is combing my website. If it were a robot, it would do everything quickly and they get automatically filtered out. Both charts and counting methodologies above do not count robots.

So all in all, things were quite good for AmericanMonk.org in 2020. Perhaps the lockdowns helped me with a captive audience! I have no idea if this growth will continue for 2021, since the pts was literally 25% and also generated other page views from that landing page. However, I will just continue as I have done before, writing about things that inspire me or information on things I think might be useful to the general public.

The website is primarily written with my parents as my target audience and they like most of what is presented on the website. It is an honor to share this information with them.

The top ten page links besides the homepage are listed below. May your new year be fruitful and lead to Peace.
