**Alms Round in Intakkaw**  
Here is a picture from my Intakkaw trip last year. The girl on the bicycle was actually a kitchen worker for the monastery. She helped prepare breakfast for us and also prepared the food we collected each day, mixed with some subsidized food from the Abbot's family. She was probably on her way to the local market to get some fresh vegetables to add to our lunch that we were in the process of collecting. The lady making a donation is usually one of the first donors on our route.ï»¿
