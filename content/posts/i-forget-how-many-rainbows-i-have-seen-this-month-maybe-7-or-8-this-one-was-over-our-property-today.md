I forget how many rainbows I have seen this month. Maybe 7 or 8? This one was over our property. Today I saw 3 Rainbows in Hanalei, including a double rainbow. Such a beautiful Island, and I really have not explored much because it is so satisfying where I am already. Yesterday was our one-month anniversary.
