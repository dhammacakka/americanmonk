Today, February 7th, is my ordination anniversary from 2001. I ordained under Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadaw on the February full moon day for the purpose of liberation. I can still remember burning my credit and bank cards the day before hoping to never to touch money ever again. I was so scared, but I knew it was the right path for me. So far, so good.  
In 1999, I left home to travel the world and possibly following my dream of becoming a monk, and that is exactly what I did.  
(I reset my ordination in 2007, so I am only 7 monk years old) ﻿
