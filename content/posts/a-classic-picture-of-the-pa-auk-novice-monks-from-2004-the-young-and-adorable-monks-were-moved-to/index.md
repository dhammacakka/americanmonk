A classic picture of the Pa-Auk novice monks from 2004. The young (and adorable) monks were moved to a center in Mahemyine. It is certainly one of my all time favorite top ten pictures from Pa-Auk.  
  
I am currently staying in Yangon at Varanasi learning monastery. There are many young samaneras here. I should snap some pictures before I leave.
