**The Construction of Mettavihari Female Meditation Hall**  
I normally shrink the size of my posted pictures. However, I left this one as the original so you can play with it. Go ahead and zoom in and move around. The second picture is the finished product. Take note that concrete (the grey stuff) burns the skin on contact.  
  
The hall was designed by "Bobby," who ordained after the project's completion. He is now known as Venerable Pannyagavesaka almost ten years later.
