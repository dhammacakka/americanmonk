**A Dying Breed**  
As Myanmar modernizes and loses its culture, these pony-carts become more rare to see. In 2001, when I first came here, they were common to see. Now, I think I have seen this two or three times in Pa-Auk over the past two years. I remember the American monk who told me about Burma in 1999, when I was just starting my journey, and still in the continental USA.  
He said, "It is like no other country...They still use ox-carts!"  
  
They do still have ox-carts, but they are rare to see these days compared to 2001, which does not seem so long ago. Today, the homemade Myanmar diesel haulers are favored over the traditional bull.
