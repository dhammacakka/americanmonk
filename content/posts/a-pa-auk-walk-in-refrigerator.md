Recently, the doctor ordered some lemon juice for me to take as medicine, so I asked the office helper for some lemons. She went into the kitchen and then to the "walk-in refrigerator." I just had to laugh and then snapped a picture.

- What does a walk-in refrigerator look like?
- How doe they make walk-in refrigerators in Myanmar Monasteries?

## Instructions:

- Take an eight by eight room,
- Lay the walls with tiles
- Insulation (optional)
- Put one or two air conditioners inside

Pa-Auk Maymyo: Only 1 air conditioner. Maybe because of the cooler climate and insulation.
