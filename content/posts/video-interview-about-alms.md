Recently, I was interviewed from an old friend who was previously a monk with me in Pa-Auk, Mawlamyine, Myanmar. Nikita was a monk for about one year before disrobing. He asked me about what it is like for a monk without money to go for alms in Kauai, Hawaii, USA. I have been doing this for about one year now, and I tell a couple of stories which are fun to listen to.
