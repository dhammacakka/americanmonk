## Introduction
Going for alms (pindapata) is certainly possible in the USA.  There are different methods such as house by house alms, farmer's market alms, visiting known donor's houses, and supermarket alms.   While house by house can take time to grow faith in a community, supermarkets can be quite easy to develop, even on the first day.

## Obtaining Permission
When the supermarket is part of a shopping complex, you will need permission from both the store manager, and also the shopping center property manager.  These days, it can be difficult to get permission from most large corporate owned shopping centers.  However, when I was in Kaua'i, Hawai'i, Ching Young Village was more than happy to let me "hang out" in front of Big Save which also gave permission for me to go.  Princevilled shopping center told me, "Not even the Boy Scouts are allowed on the property."  Below is a picture of me hanging out with permission while the other is me pacing on the public sidewalk.

## Cultural Integration in Elgin
Elgin has a large amount of Lao Immigrants and there is an asian food store called Golden Market within 1.3 miles from the Lao monastery.  It is Vietnamese owned, but those who are from SE Asia also shop there for their own needs.  The first day, unannounced, a Lao lady happened to stumble upon us.  The next day, the same thing happened with two others.  We still do not get abundant food to live off of (yet), but it inspires the local community, we get exercise, meditation time, and a chance for others to make mera large amount of Legal Considerations
and there is an asian food called Golden Market store protesters or those strike are allowed to legal and I checked with a Buddhist friend who is a lawyer long ago before ever going for alms in America long long ago. You are not allowed to loiter though.  That is why the people on strike walk in circles.  If they keep moving, they are not loitering. 
As monks, we are only "protesting" greed, hatred and delusion.    

## Keeping A Low Profile
Legal as it is, the owner's daughter is Vietnamese and not Buddhist.  She said he would not call the police or challenge the monks or those that used her parking lot.  However, she was not comfortable with the situation.  With that, I decided to move across the street so that it was more passive.  In this way my precense was disconnected with her business while I was still "visible" to those who understood what we were doing.  

These pictures were taken on earlier days when I was on the same side as the business.  Now, I'm on the other side of the street which is mostly residential.

## Alms-Gathering Process
The entire process takes one and a half hours to complete.  It takes 30 minutes to walk to the store.  Then I take off my slippers and walk slowly back and forth for about 30 minutes and then we return to the monastery.  It is good exercise, a good chance to meditate, and a good chance for people to make merit.  When we arrive back to the monastery, the monstery donors are also waiting to do a small donation in the bowl (usually with desserts for the day's meal).  After that, we accept a table that has rice and curries and move on to the daily schedule which includes chanting, meditation and a small dhamma talk.

## Summary Poem
In the land of liberty's vast expanse,  
A monk walks with a silent chant.  
Supermarkets, streets, where alms are sought,  
In America, a sacred tradition is taught.

Golden Market, under open skies,  
A bowl extends, humanity ties.  
Strangers pause, gifts they share,  
Acts of kindness, moments rare.

Paths of merit, steps of peace,  
From Elgin to the tranquil East.  
A journey blending heart and creed,  
In every alms, a noble deed.
