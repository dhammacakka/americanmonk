Donation Day today at Pa-Auk.  
This is a time where all of the teachers come together from the 29 local Myanmar monasteries. There are 11monasteries abroad if you want to count the USA branch.  
This is also a time when large or huge amounts of donations are made. We filled 2.5 rice sacks with goods today! While most of it was superfluous goods, like washing powder, soap and notebooks, there are some special things as well. I gave away most of it including two sets of robes to Varanasi Monastery. The big pile is what I gave away and the small pile is what I kept.  
  
The bags have our names on them and are brought over to the upper monastery by truck. You can see the monks sorting through their bags.  
  
I also sent another two sets of robes to Thailand and another two sets of robes to Varanasi Monastery earlier. 6 robes in total.  
There were some special insulated cups too. I gave those away to Varanasi Monastery too. I have grown to like rice porridge mixed with tea in the morning for breakfast and like the idea of less dishes to wash.
