During the kitchen preparation time, the females were meditating in their separate three story meditation hall. Work is optional and may need special permission to do so. 10 Precept Nuns can ordain here as monastics. Nauyana, Sri Lanka has a similar arrangement with Dhammika Ashram. This was only the first or second time that I have been in this hall during a meditation session.
