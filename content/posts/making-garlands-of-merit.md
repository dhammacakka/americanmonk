Recently, I have been making more posts in video format.  I share personal stories along with the dhamma.  While most of you might be more insterested in monk life than the dhamma, we will still be doing both.

This Dhammatalk explores the Dhammapada verse 53 and the different aspects of making merit
I think you will like it.
