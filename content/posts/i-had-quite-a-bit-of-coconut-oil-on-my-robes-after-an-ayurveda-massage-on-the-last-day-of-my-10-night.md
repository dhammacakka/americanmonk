I had quite a bit of coconut oil on my robes after an Ayurveda Massage on the last day of my 10 night fast. About half of the robe was discolored Detergent and hot water did not remove the oil and it was still discolored. I asked a Sinhala monk if he knew a way and he told me to smear clay all over the robe and then let it completely dry in the hot sun. I was a little skeptical and the local Myanmar people won't dig into a termite mound either. I arranged for clay from another source and later ended up with ten or twenty times what I needed (from a river). I did what was prescribed and much of the oil came out. I might try it again since I did not get a full drying done since rainy season is inching up. However, it is very satisfactory now compared to before. It was difficult to see where the oil was without wearing it. In retrospect, the camera shot reveals where I needed more clay. What a mess to wash! It did work to some extent though and might be useful for anyone to know about.
