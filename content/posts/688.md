I went to the sacred Blue Room cave today with a friend named Narayandass. Its waters are known for their healing powers. I made a recording of some chanting before we meditated there. It was a special time and extremely high on my "Before I Go" list. A recording can be found at [https://archive.org/details/Blueroomkauai](https://archive.org/details/Blueroomkauai). The raw recording has nothing added but was trimmed at the beginning and end of the file.

I got permission to go to ITBMU from my teachers in Sri Lanka. I am eligible from the exam I took 2 years ago. I think I might go. That is the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary University in Myanmar.

I got my passport this past Tuesday with my Myanmar meditation visa inside. (Note: It was only one week before our return tickets). Phew!
