If anyone is interested in reading up on great organization. This one seems to be very good. I have read their newsletters for quite a while. There were some things I ethically opposed to and do not recommend, but for disaster relief (and that is my focus of praise), they are quite high. They are in Nepal now and often at every place where disaster strikes. I am most impressed in their way they deliver goods to victims. They bow their heads and offer. According to their newsletters, they don't just leave when the hype dies down. They rebuild and manage for the longterm. Although Mahayana at heart, I say Sadhu to their humanitarian disaster relief effortsï»¿
