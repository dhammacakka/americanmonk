I asked openai chatGPT to write a buddhist poem on loving-kindness in the style of Dr. Seuss. This is what I got.  
  

> With open hearts and open hands,  
> We spread loving-kindness across the lands.  
> Like ripples on a pond, it starts with one,  
> But soon it touches everyone.
> 
> With each kind word and thoughtful deed,  
> We plant the seeds of love, in hearts to breed.  
> For in this world of joy and pain,  
> Love is the balm to ease all strains.
> 
> So let us be like candles bright,  
> Shining our love into the night.  
> For in this world of dark and cold,  
> Love is the warmth that makes us bold.
> 
> With love in our hearts and peace in our minds,  
> We'll walk the path of enlightenment to find.  
> For in this world of birth and death,  
> Love is the guide that leads us to our best.

Here is another Buddhist poem written by AI. It was posted by someone who commented on my FB post about this. The poems take about 3 to 5 seconds to generate.

> The path to enlightenment  
> Is like a winding road  
> Through mountains tall and valleys low  
> With each step, we shed our load
> 
> The mind is like a monkey  
> Jumping from thought to thought  
> But with mindfulness, we can tame it  
> And reach inner peace, we've sought
> 
> Let go of all desires  
> And attachments will fall  
> Embrace the present moment  
> And hear the Buddha's call
> 
> For in stillness and serenity  
> We'll find true liberation  
> And our hearts will be filled  
> With boundless compassion.
