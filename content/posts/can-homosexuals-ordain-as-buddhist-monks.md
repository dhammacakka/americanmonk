## Summary:
Yes, it is possible, but it is difficult to recommended because it can be very dangerous for saṅgha.  Some monasteries will prohibit ordinations of openly gay men.  

Why?  The short answer is that the monastic environment is specifically designed to be segregated for celibacy.  Segregation of genders breaks when homosexuals are ordained and mix with other monks.  This is true especially at large monasteries where there is less supervision.  

Nevertheless, while I have not counted or confirmed who is who in the monasteries, I would imagine that there are some good monks who are homosexual and doing very well.  Generally speaking, there is a "Don't ask don't tell" policy.  It is best to focus on the spiritual life instead.

## Perception Of Uncontrollable Lust
The senior monks will assume that the monks who are homosexual have uncontrollable lust because their exposure is related to  cases in their own monastery or neighboring ones where a monk has engaged in this behavior and perhaps with multiple monks.  It destroys the life of that monk as well as the monks involved. It is for this reason that this perception exists because lust went beyond the mind and control was lost.  Is this a representation of all homosexuals?  No, but I'm explaining why the perception exists.   

## Environment for celibacy
In a monastic environment, most potential dangers are removed through segregation of men and women.  Most monasteries prohibit women from visiting after hours, let alone sleeping in a monastery.  In short, if there are no women then there is no possibility for sex with women.  For this reason, that danger does not exist.  However, when it comes to homosexuals, that segregation cannot happen.

Ven Ananda once asked in the Mahāparinibbānasutta (DN 16)  
>**“kathaṃ mayaṃ, bhante, mātugāme paṭipajjāmā”ti?“**
>sir, how do we proceed when it comes to females?” 
>
>**“adassanaṃ, ānandā”ti.**
>“without seeing, ānanda.” 
>
>**“dassane, bhagavā, sati kathaṃ paṭipajjitabban”ti?**
>“but when seeing, how to proceed?” 
>
>**“anālāpo, ānandā”ti.**
>“without getting into conversation, ānanda.”

## Living with Nuns
If a monk were to live with nuns, it would be very difficult for him to be happy with his monk life because lust would naturally arise.  In fact, not so long ago, there was a highly skilled meditation teacher who ended up having sex with a nun because he had too much contact with women.   He was immediately disrobed the moment the act happened whether he told anyone or not. Even though he was a great meditation practitioner and teacher, we could still say he had uncontrollable lust.  Why?  He didn't control it and it was lost due to constant exposure to the attracted gender.  

## Homosexuals living with monks
In the same way, a homosexual monk who lives with other monks, could be a problem.  It would be natural for lust to arise.  When visitors are not around, we often walk around topless or with skimpy shoulder cloths.  Some monasteries have saunas and monks are allowed to go naked in them (although many don't).  Would you like to try celibacy and live with near topless nuns?  Even if you are an extreme liberal, you should be able to see this as a problem.

## Are there any homosexuals who have ordained?
Yes.  Ajahn Brahm has been known to be open to ordaining homosexuals in his monastery.  His place has been recommended once to a person who wanted to ordain but could not do so at Pa-Auk.  Pa-Auk monastery prohibits *openly gay* and sexually experienced homosexuals from ordaining.  Sometimes people don't figure out who they really are until later in age.  They might ordain thinking they don't have much desire for women, and therefore monk life might be easy.  Even though they are "biologically" gay, their ordination is still valid.  There are only special cases where the male genitals are deformed or missing invalidates an ordination.  So one who is gay but didn't figure it out before he ordained would definitely know his status with the practice of extreme celibacy. Celibacy is one of the main defining characters of being a monk.  If you are not celibate, you are not a monk.  When extreme celibacy is practiced, the lust will naturally arise when the objects of lust are present.  One can maintain control through mindfulness, but a segregated monastic environment has limited objects for the lust objects to even be present.

## Paṇḍakas And Ordination Restrictions
> Paṇḍaka is usually translated as eunuch, but eunuchs are only one of five types of paṇḍakas recognized by the Commentary to Mv.I.61:
> 1) An āsitta (literally, a "sprinkled one") — a man whose sexual
> desire is allayed by performing fellatio on another man and bringing
> him to climax. (Some have read this as classing all homosexual males
> as paṇḍakas, but there are two reasons for not accepting this interpretation: (a) It seems unlikely that many homosexuals would allay their sexual desire simply by bringing someone else to climax through oral sex; (b) other homosexual acts, even though they were known in ancient India, are not included under this type or under any of the types in this list.) 
> 2) A voyeur — a man whose sexual desire is allayed by watching other people commit sexual indiscretions. 
> 3) A eunuch — one who has been castrated. 
> 4) A half-time paṇḍaka — one who is a paṇḍaka only during the waning moon. (! >  The Sub-commentary's discussion of this point shows that its author and his contemporaries were as unfamiliar with this type as we are today. Perhaps this was how bisexuals were understood in ancient times.) 
> 5) A neuter — a person born without sexual organs. 
> 
> This passage in the Commentary further states that the last three types cannot take the Going-forth, while the first two can (although it also quotes from the Kurundī that the half-time paṇḍaka is forbidden from going-forth only during the waning moon (!).) As for the prohibition in Mv.I.61, that paṇḍakas cannot receive full ordination, the Commentary states that that refers only to those who cannot take the Going-forth.

## Ancient Speculation of Homosexual Dangers
While only the last three types of the five types of paṇḍakas is absolutely prohibited from ordaining (and invalid if done), the origin of why paṇḍakas are not allowed to ordain seems to implicate that homosexuals can be a very big problem if they ordain.  The story is found here:

> In the origin story for this prohibition, a paṇḍaka who had received full ordination unsuccessfully propositioned some bhikkhus and novices, and then succeeded in propositioning some horse-and-elephant-trainers, who spread it about, "These
Sakyan-son monks are paṇḍakas. And those among them who are not paṇḍakas molest paṇḍakas."  (BMC Vol. 2, page 187)

## Don't Ask Don't Tell
There is a don't ask don't tell policy and there are definitely monks already ordained who have the voice and mannerisms of being gay.  However *that does not always mean they are gay*, and we don't usually ask about internal sexual desires.  If it is controllable, and not an issue, there is no need to tell and there is no need to ask.  However, some may not feel "right" if they living in hiding all the time.

Of course we have compassion towards all beings and wish to give the monastic opportunity to everyone.  If the homosexual is the only one in very small monastery, then it might not be such an issue.  Nevertheless, I have heard that Ajahn Brahm has some extra "check-ins" with such monks to see if everything is working out okay.  Even still, lust will arise and even in a small monastery.  The monks might be topless when the lay people are not around, give massages to senior monks, etc.  This is just not appropriate for homosexuals to be doing while practicing extreme celibacy.  While a small monastery might work, travel is common and should we restrict such monks from going to larger unsupervised monasteries?  It would be awkward and difficult to restrict.  

## Rules on Speaking Lewd Words And Touching The Opposite Sex
Besides automatic expulsion for any type of sexual activity, we have two rules about direct and indirect lewd speech spoken to the opposite gender. We also have a rule about lustful physical contact with the opposite gender. If a monk breaks these saṅghādisesa rules, he must seek penance and probation for a minimum of six nights in front of his peers. Even the slightest lewd words or lustful touches entail full punishment. It is a serious matter and helps prevent the more severe rule on expulsion from being invoked. There is one exception: there are no strong consequences for interactions between monks or between nuns.  

## Incidents
There have been incidents at various monasteries.  This is often seen with novice monks, but can also happen with fully ordained bhikkhus.  It is for this reason that strong "blanket" policies have been made.  While this might be unfair, it can allow for 93% of the population to have potential ordinations assuming a generous 7% homosexuality rate is correct. Some academic online sources say it is far less.

## More On Segregation
Segregation of the genders helps create an environment that minimizes distractions and temptations, thereby allowing monks to devote themselves fully to their spiritual practices. This arrangement is designed to support a life of deep meditation and study, essential for progress on the path to enlightenment

Segregation breaks down with homosexuals and it can be similar to a monk living in a nunnery filled with many young nuns.  There have been problems in the past, and because of this, perceptions have been formed by the senior monks who had to deal with such individuals who have violated the most important rules of being a celibate monk.  

## Summary
The topic of Homosexuals in monasteries is a touchy subject and it would be best if there were a proper solution to meet everyone's needs.  In theravāda, we still recommend celibacy as a best practice for both heterosexuals and homosexuals.  Obviously, being a monk gives one an environment to practice that way but that environment is only designed for heterosexuals living in segregated residential quarters.  

Being born with a homosexual orientation presents unique challenges within the traditional monastic framework, which is primarily designed for celibate life segregated by gender. This reality calls us to reflect deeply on the nature of saṃsāra and the complexities of human experience. It is a reminder of our shared journey towards enlightenment, which requires us to cultivate understanding and create conditions where every individual can strive for spiritual liberation, to reach Nibbāna.
