**Although I do not see myself posting anymore on the Buddhist and Spiritual Communities**, you are welcome to reshare my posts in your communities or your gplus pages yourself. These will be posted on my gplus circles and made public with sharing enabled.  
  
The first Abhidhamma Post has been shared to several groups except Buddhism and Meditation and it was tiring to do.  
The second Abhidhamma post on the singular mind with an example on mercy killing has not been shared to any Buddhist and Spiritual communities to date.  
  
I will continue to share some posts to Philosophy of Mind, (and some others) with Abhidhamma related stuff because that was where I was first inspired to write about Abhidhamma.
