**I Got Kauai On My Mind** Monks have often lived in the King's Parks during the time of the Buddha, yet few or maybe none actually do it these days. I have been thinking much about going to Kauai, Hawaii recently. Kauai ranks high on my list of "Beautiful Places" in the world. Next to relationships and my guitar, or maybe ahead of them, Kauai is my lost love in life and I can touch it too! (Women and musical instruments should not be touched by bhikkhus).  
  
Kauai has a wonderful and flexible beach park system, legal for camping, and I hope to make it work with myself and another monk. You did not think I would go alone would you? I have done research and I am quite positive it can work out.  
  
The strung flowers on my alter look differently these days.
