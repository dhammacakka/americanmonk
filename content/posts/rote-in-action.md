**Rote in Action**  
The monk on the left was reciting while his friend checked to see if he was correct. Here, he made a mistake and his friend is pointing it out to him. Not only can the young monks read and memorize, but they do it at the same speed as the guy who reads the fine print at the end of a car lease commercial. Of course, in a third language. Many of these Ethnic Nepal/Myanmar residents grow up with a Nepal mother tongue and then learn Myanmar language. Pali will be their third language.  
Varanasi Monastery, Mingaladon, Myanmar.
