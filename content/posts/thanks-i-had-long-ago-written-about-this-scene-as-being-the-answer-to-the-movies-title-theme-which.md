Thanks.  I had long ago written about this scene as being the answer to the movie's title theme which asks "What is beautiful?" and that most people incorrectly believe it was family.  A person who was editing my writing found this link and I was grateful that I remembered it correctly and that someone else felt it was good enough to post on YouTube.﻿
