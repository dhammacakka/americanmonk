#### The Allowability of Ride-Hailing Services

In modern times, ride-hailing apps like Uber or Sri Lanka's PickMe or Grab in Myanamr and Thailand offer a convenient way to arrange transportation. Although monks are not allowed to use money directly, these services can still be used in accordance with vinaya rules if properly arranged through a kappiya or donor. 

### What Is A Kappiya?

A kappiya is a designated layperson who handles monetary transactions with funds allocated for his needs so the monk does not need to use money.  The word *Kappiya* is a noun for the verb kappeti which literally means "to make allowable", It is based on the root √kapp which means to be fit or suitable.  A donor arranges things directly with his own means as a direct donation.  In most cases a kappiya is different than a donor.  Usually he does not use his own funds to support the monk.  Greg is also a donor in some ways, but I prefer to refer to him as "Kappiya Greg" since most of what we have been doing for the past 10 years is Kappiya related.

### Invitation Statement 
Here Greg, has made such an arrangement for me. Here is his invitation statement:

> **Kappiya Greg**
> "Bhante Subhuti, I have arranged everything with PickMe or Uber so that you can go anywhere you want. The settings are already set up to use the card. They will deduct my Visa debit card and I will cover the charges. Please use the app to arrange the rides as per the videos. I will cover up to 90,000 LKR. If your PickMe or Uber settings change, please select the card 'Visa... 1090'. This is my kappiya arrangement with the ride-hailing company which arranges with your driver. Enjoy the rides, and if they are good, please give them a tip or pre-tip for me for whatever amount you feel is appropriate and share some light of kindness in the world. Please let me know how this works out or if you have any trouble."

Here you can see that this invitation keeps everything as an allowable arrangement. I simply use the app to request a ride, and when the ride arrives, I provide a code to the driver to identify myself.  When I use this app, there is no direct exchange of money everything is handled through the kappiya's pre-arranged system.  It should be noted that he logged into my account (I gave him the SMS code), and set everything up.  Would it be allowable for him to invite me to use the app and ask me to enter his card information myself? Possibly — but I prefer to avoid going that far.

#### The Importance of the Invitation

It is crucial to note that this arrangement is only allowable because Greg invited me to use the service. The invitation is what makes the difference. **If Kappiya Greg had merely added his card to my app without directly inviting me to use it, it would not be allowed.**

In Vinaya, we must always be invited by the donor.  I explain this with my post on {{< extlink "https://americanmonk.org/how-do-monks-live-without-money/" "How do monks live without money?" >}}.  When someone gives money to the kappiya, they must invite the monk correctly.  If they do not, then the requisites cannot be used.  To simplify this process and always be consistent, a small donation form with the correct wording is mentioned and given to the monk. The same must be done for Uber etc.  In fact, I told the kappiya what to say in the invitation.  He modified it himself, but he was a monk and knows vinaya.  Other people should be careful about modifying things.  The kappiya, made the arrangement with the vendor.  In Kaua'i I was invited to go to the Hanalei Bakery and mention so and so's name if I ever needed food.  Afterwards, he would pay.  In Niantic, CT, my father gave an envelope to the manager at a food store and invited me to ask the store for a helper to get me anything I needed.  In this case of Uber, Greg’s invitation tells me that he transferred his kappiya duties to the Uber or PickMe service and to use it.  When the ride is finished, Greg Card gets a bill.  Eventually, it is automatically paid. I think you can see similarities.   **The most important part is that the kappiya must invite us to use the app / service and specify how it should be done. Without this, the arrangement would not be allowable.**



This method can also be applied to other services like food or coffee shop gift cards. As long as the arrangement is pre-made, invited, and the kappiya pays, it remains within the allowable boundaries of Vinaya.  However, the invitation is needed.

1. There are allowable requisites in the form of a gift card arranged by the donor.  
2. There is an open invitation by the donor to use the gift card until the amount is finished. 
3. The gift card is given or sent by app to the monk.  
4. The gift card is used by the monk to gain items.  


### When Do Things Go To Far?

As technology advances, monks must carefully consider the implications of adopting methods, ensuring they align with the **spirit of the Vinaya** as well as **the letter of the Vinaya**.  We need to be careful we do not remove the connection with the lay community for our needs.  And this aspect gets diminished as we will discuss below:

#### The Feeling of Independence

While this system is allowable, there is a certain feeling of independence that has both benefits and drawbacks. Normally, as monks, we rely on donors to provide rides for us. This reliance is not only part of our training in humility but also provides an opportunity for donors to generate merit and cultivate generosity.

When I use Uber or PickMe to arrange my own rides, I feel somewhat uneasy. It is as if I have removed an important opportunity for someone to help. For example, when traveling to the airport, monks are often "seen off" by donors who make the effort to accompany us. This shared effort creates a meaningful connection and reflects the natural dependence monks have on lay supporters. With ride-hailing apps, I often end up traveling alone without that warmth of shared presence from helpers or donors.  Will I go to the airport alone this coming April?  Probably, and if that makes you frown a bit or feel sad that I go alone, then you have captured the downside of monks gaining their independence through ride hailing apps.

This brings to mind the teaching from the Dasadhamma Sutta:

> **"parapaṭibaddhā me jīvikā" ti,**
>
> *"I am bound to others for my livelihood",*
>
> *pabbajitena abhiṇhaṁ paccavekkhitabbaṁ.*
>
> *"One who has gone forth should frequently reflect on this."*"*

This reminder encourages us to reflect on the value of relying on others and maintaining a healthy balance between independence and community support.  The Buddha made several rules which makes us dependent on lay people.

- not to use money  
- not to engage in trade  
- not to store food  
- not to cook  
- not to eat anything that has not been offered  

When you look at those rules, you can understand that the Buddha did not want us to be fully independent.  We are not independent though.  The app is set up with the Kappiya and the donors.  However, if you feel the warmth is gone, I must agree.

#### The Dangers of Convenience

As things become more convenient, we naturally become less dependent on others. This can have spiritual downsides. When donors actively support monks, they cultivate wholesome intentions and strengthen their connection with the Saṅgha. Many more mind moments are spent with such acts of giving.

Convenience services like Uber and Amazon start to resemble the functionality of money itself. The more seamless the system becomes, the more we must reflect on why we became monks in the first place — to cultivate simplicity and dependence on lay support, which nurtures both humility and generosity in the world.

For this reason, the Vinaya emphasizes sticking to single-vendor systems like phone credit, stamps, or meal coupons. These limit excessive convenience while still remaining manageable for donors. By contrast, ride-hailing apps connect with multiple drivers, which blurs the line and requires careful thought. Amazon, for example, opens up limitless options, making it feel even closer to directly using money, even though it is technically not using money and still an arrangement with a "store".

#### A Practical Compromise

For the time being, I have chosen to use Uber and PickMe primarily to manage my transportation to Kelaniya for my university classes two Saturdays a month. While I could arrange these rides through the local monastery that lets me stay there the night before, this makes things less of a burden to my host. But as we said before, there is less love with this convenience.  A wife and kids are burdens, but you love them and you are willing to help them even though you might not have time.  Where would you draw the line for your kids to use Uber?

The key is to remain mindful of the purpose behind such arrangements. As monks, we rely on donors not just to fulfill physical needs but to provide opportunities for them to cultivate merit. By making conscious choices about convenience, we can maintain this balance while still living practically in the modern world.

#### A Summary Poem

> Ease may seem like comfort's gain,  
> Yet brings a loss we can’t explain.  
> Relying on hearts, their warmth so near,  
> Forms bonds of merit so bright and clear.  
>   
> But when we're alone and convenience thrives,  
> The warmth of shared kindness no longer survives.  
> With hands not joined and hearts untied,  
> The giver’s joy grows faint inside.
