**Cats Like To Eat Corn**  
Did you know that cats like corn? Try it, or let them try it. Dogs really like corn too (leave it on the cob). Dogs like just about anything and can survive well on a vegetarian diet of leftover rice and curry.  
The picture is of my neighbour's cat's daughter eating my leftover corn removed from the cob at his kuti.﻿
