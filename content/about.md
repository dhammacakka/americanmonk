Originally a contract computer programmer by trade, Bhante Subhūti is an American Buddhist Monk with roots in the Sri Lanka and Myanmar Forest Traditions. He was ordained in 2001 under The Most Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadawgyi as his preceptor, a monk who is known for his strict practice of meditation and following the full list of monks’ rules which is very rare in the world today.

In 2007 he chose to go to Na-Uyana Monastery in Sri Lanka which also had similar rules and meditation standards. In Sri Lanka and still as a monk, he went through another ordination ceremony which reset his rain count and therefore, his seniority. He returned again to Pa-Auk in Myanmar in 2012. In 2015 and again in 2018, Bhante Subhūti had an opportunity to go to Kaua’i, Hawai’i, USA. He returned to school and earned a Diploma in Buddhism at the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary University in 2017. Currently Bhante Subhūti is living in Sri Lanka at The International Institute of Theravāda.

Bhante Subhūti is very strict in following the Theravada Buddhist monks’ 227 rules, and has not handled money throughout his monastic life. He enjoys meditation, learning, teaching and collecting his meals by alms whether it be in Myanmar, Sri Lanka or Kaua’i itself.

Bhante Subhūti’s writings are not affiliated with nor represent Pa-Auk or Na-Uyana. His wriings are independent unless he specifically states so.
