# Privacy Policy for Buddhist Compass App

**Application:** Buddhist Compass  
This compass app is a product of Bhante Subhuti and is open source. Bhante may refer to himself collectively as “we,” “us,” or “our.” Bhante is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) describes how Bhante processes Personal Data in his capacity as a controller. In short: **no personal data is collected.** All data remains on your device.

---

## Information Collected
The Buddhist Compass app does not collect or transmit any personal information.  
The only information received by the developer is anonymous aggregate data from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, such as the number of downloads, installs, country of origin, crash reports, and similar anonymous metrics that the stores provide to all developers.

## Location Data
**What Personal Data Does Buddhist Compass Use and Why?**

- **GPS and Location:**  
  Buddhist Compass uses GPS services to obtain your current latitude and longitude so it can calculate the bearing and distance to a chosen destination (such as Bodh Gaya). This location data is used only inside the app. Nothing is transmitted to the developer. GPS is requested while the app is running; it is not streamed or tracked in the background without your knowledge.

- **Background Use:**  
  Buddhist Compass does not run in the background. Location is only used while the app is open and in active use. You may choose to deny location permissions, but then compass and distance features will not function.

- **User Preferences:**  
  The app stores your chosen destination and basic settings locally on your device. This information is not transmitted and is not encrypted.

## Commitment to Privacy
We believe privacy is important.  
- No personal information is collected or shared.  
- Nothing is sold to third parties.  
- The only benefit to the developer is merit in providing a Buddhist practice tool.  

---

## Security
Your data is not transmitted to the developer. Security depends on your device’s own protections. Stored preference data is simple and unencrypted.

---

## Links to Third-Party Sites
The app may link to websites or rely on open-source Flutter packages. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies separately.

---

## Children’s Privacy
Buddhist Compass does not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 16 — or from anyone at all.

---

## Amendments
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted to this page. Material changes may be announced with a notice on our website. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of any changes.

---

## Legal Disclosure
We may disclose information if required by law, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, or to comply with judicial processes. Since the app does not collect personal data, this is unlikely to apply.
