# Privacy Policy for My Time Schedule

**Application**: My Time Schedule  
**Developer**: Bhante Subhuti (AmericanMonk.org)

---

## What Data Is Collected?

**None.**  
My Time Schedule does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All schedule and to-do information is stored only on your device.

The only information the developer receives is from Google Play Console, which includes anonymous statistics such as number of installs, country of install, and crash reports. This information is provided automatically to all developers and does not include personal data.

---

## Permissions Used

- **Notifications**: Used to alert you when a timer finishes.
- **Local storage**: Used to store your schedule preferences and task list.

All permissions are used only for the core functionality of the app. No data is sent externally.

---

## Background Operation

If enabled in settings, the app may run in the background to allow voice notifications while the screen is off. This feature is optional and is activated only if the user enables it.

---

## Security

All data remains on your device and is stored locally in app preferences. This data is not encrypted but is only accessible by the app unless your device is compromised.

---

## Children

My Time Schedule does not knowingly collect data from children. In fact, it collects no data from anyone.

---

## Third-Party Links

The app may use open-source Flutter packages. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those packages if you're concerned about third-party data behavior. However, My Time Schedule itself does not transmit any data to third parties.

---

## Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated over time. Any changes will be posted here at [americanmonk.org](https://americanmonk.org). Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of any updates.
