This is Ven Indavimala. {{< url-out "why-i-ordained-twice" "During my re-ordination in 2007" >}}, the ones who were previously ordained got to go first by previous seniority. This is to preserve previous order of seniority to those who lost it before, but the seniority only resides in our year of ordination (if that makes sense). Technically we are all the same monk age in years. We are all 17 years or vassa.  However, the monk with the most experience will be ordained before the other and he will be senior sometimes by a day, an hour, or even by a mere second.  It is sort of like twins, if they know who was "born" first. Ven Maggavihari is the baby of our year and was in the very last group to ordain with a Chinese monk in the next day. He has only ordained once which is how it should be.

(Left to Right) Ven Devānanda, myself, Ven. Indavimala, Ven. Dhammanissanti, Ven. Maggavihāri are all ordained from June 18 & 19, 2007.

## More On Ordering
There were three monks in each group and a few groups were re-ordaining. Ven Dewananda was in the first group of three because he has many many years of ordination beforehand.  Ven. Devananda is 3 hours senior to me.  I was in the third group of 3. In our group of three, Ven Indavimala was the one who came after me. He is roughly one second junior to me and I am roughly one second senior to him. He is sitting next to me. There is nobody else who who can be between us in seniority.  When a monk is senior, it does not matter "how much senior he is", we respect him all the same, especially when we ourselves are senior.  We give the top respect, even for a few hours of seniority.  This ordering is explained in my article, {{< url-out "the-order-of-monks-how-seniority-shapes-the-buddhist-monastic-life" "The Order Of Monks: How Seniority Shapes The Buddhist Monastic Life" >}}.
When he went to India for a pilgrimage, he needed a bowl bag. I gave him my own personal knitted bowl bag so he would have a good trip. It was nice to see him after all of these years .

Ven Indavimala is now an abbot of his own monastery in the Kandy mountains
