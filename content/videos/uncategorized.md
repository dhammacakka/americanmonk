{{< video-card id="Q1xzLs3KSyM" title="Abortion: First Precept #theravada #buddhism #abortion" date="2026-02-20" >}}
Late term abortion, there's no controversy. You have a living being, you have perception that it's a living being, you have desire to end the life of that living being. You make an effort by signing consent forms and giving commands to the doctor. The doctor is also involved with this and that unborn child dies. So we have five factors.  So the question is, what about an early term abortion? So in Theravada Buddhism, life starts with Patisandhi. This is the rebirth linking consciousness. Basically, when the egg becomes fertilized, that is when life begins.  96% of biologists believe that life begins at fertilization. Although many might not believe that it's really fully a human, they probably believe it is alive, more than a plant.  We have a commentarial story in Prajika called the Elaka Chatuka. Elaka means goat and Chatuka means the four stories related to the goats. There's a person who sees an image in the dark, let's say a hunter, and he decides he wants to kill that image. But he thinks it's a goat and he kills that living being. Later the lights come on and he sees that it's his mother who is on all fours or under a blanket. His intention was for a goat. It turned out to be not only human, but his own mother.  The severity of the kama is with the reality of what actually died. So it doesn't matter whether you believe that it's some type of animal or whether you believe it's some type of whatever. If you have all five factors, then the reality is that it's human. And that's how the kama is. And that's why monks have to be very careful about how they give advice. So it's very important.

Here we talk about the kamma of manslaughter as it relates to the first precept of killing.  The short of the short video answer is, \"while there is not kamma for killing, there is other kamma for drinking and negligence.\" Even though you would go to jail, the kamma of killing is not complete because the five factors are not there.

(2:00) Self-defense in the social justice system normally allows you to escape punishment if it was a case of self-defense. Even protecting yourself or protecting your family is very clear.  You have people with guns who have already killed a couple of people and they're ready to kill you. You happen to have a gun and you kill them before they kill you. This is clear-cut. In self-defense, if you have Facebook glasses on and you're recording everything, it's going to go to court, they're going to mark it as self-defense, and you're not going to go to jail.  Most of the time, we never know: how does this happen with karma and the five factors? Well, this person who's creating a lot of trouble has already killed someone, he's ready to kill you, and he's got a gun pointed at you. You pull your gun. He's a living being; you see him as a living being. Yes, then you want to kill him—you literally want to kill him; you shoot to kill. Yes, so you want to destroy the life force. Then we have the effort: you fire a gun. And the result: he dies.  So, in terms of kamma, this is killing. This is still killing, even though the social justice system would let you off the hook. Kamma would not let you off the hook. And so this is where the law of dhamma, the law of kamma, is not necessarily fair—it is the law of Saṃsāra. Saṃsāra is not fair. It's always there to trap you; it's always there to keep you suffering. And so this is how we judge self-defense. The best thing to do is run away, and don't carry guns. Don't carry guns; you get into trouble.

{{< video-card id="Au6oMgPq8EM" title="Commentary On Right View For Killing" date="2026-02-11" >}}
(2:02) In the commentary to the Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta, which is the discourse on Right View, it explains that we have the Pañca Sambhāra. These are the five factors needed to make the kamma complete. As I said before, we have the object, perception, intention, effort, and result.  The object is a living being. The perception is the perception of a living being—knowing it is a living being. Then we have intention, the intention to destroy that life. Next, we have the effort, whether this is a physical action like shooting or stabbing, or even arranging for a hired assassin, setting booby traps, digging a pit, or doing anything else that will result in death. It also includes giving a command, giving the okay, or giving consent.  So, we take these five factors and apply them to murder, which is very easy to see, whether the victim is a human, an animal, or an insect. Let's suppose someone wants to shoot and kill another person, like an assassin. He sees a man and wants to shoot him. He perceives him as a living being. He wants to destroy the life force of that living being. He makes an effort by firing a gun. He shoots, and the person dies. Now, sometimes the result happens later, but when the result happens as a direct cause of the previous four factors, then the kamma of killing is complete.

{{< video-card id="qaLIANEPigg" title="What About Cats? #buddhism" date="2026-02-08" >}}
What about cats? We have outdoor cats, and they kill mice, birds, cockroaches, and many other things.   Some people assume that because killing is part of an animal’s nature, there are no karmic consequences for the animal. But that is not the case. The Buddha taught that it is extremely rare to encounter a Buddha, and it is equally rare for the opportunity to be born as a human being to arise. We must truly understand how extraordinarily rare human birth is.  When a being is born as an animal, it is very easy to spiral downward even further—that is why we speak of “spiraling down.” Cats, for instance, are constantly killing because they are hungry and need food. They will pursue and take the life of what they perceive as an inferior species, catch it, bite it, kill it, and eat it. When a cat targets a bird, there is a clear object: a living being. The cat recognizes it as alive, desires to kill it, desires to eat it, jumps on it, catches it, bites it, kills it—and the creature dies. All five factors of intentional killing are present in that sequence. This is precisely why the cat will experience suffering as a result of that kamma.  However, it is possible to keep an indoor cat and avoid this outcome. Feed it food that is already dead, prevent it from going outside, and ensure there are no cockroaches or other creatures in the house for it to kill. In such conditions, the cat does not accumulate the karma of killing. Moreover, it enjoys positive association with humans, which may give it a better chance for future improvement. A dog kept in similar circumstances might have an even greater opportunity.  The essential point remains: human birth is extraordinarily rare, and we should never take it for granted.
