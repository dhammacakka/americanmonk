I will be going to the USA in a few days.  I was thinking of all of the anger that is on the left these days.  When the left is in control, it is the opposite.  Loving-kindness is a good thing and should be practiced often.

Update March 19, Protections, Leaches, Monks and Khandha Paritta.  Here is a small \"walk and talk\" update while on my way for alms.  This time, I had a friend who came with me and was willing to film me while I talked.     (Ven Anandajoti translation.) “Virūpakkhehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Erāpathehi me, “I am friendly with the Virūpakkhas, with the Erāpathas I am friendly,  Chabyāputtehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Kaṇhāgotamakehi ca. [01] I am friendly with the Chabyāputtas, and friendly with the Kaṇhāgotamakas.     Apādakehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ dipādakehi me, I am friendly with those without feet, with those with two feet I am friendly,  catuppadehi  me mettaṁ, mettaṁ bahuppadehi me. [02] I am friendly with those with four feet, with those with many feet I am friendly.     Mā maṁ apādako hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi dipādako, May the one without feet not hurt me, may the one with two feet not hurt me,  mā maṁ catuppado hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi bahuppado. [03] may the one with four feet not hurt me, may the one with many feet not hurt me.     Sabbe sattā, sabbe pāṇā, sabbe bhūtā ca kevalā, May all beings, all living creatures, all who are born, in their entirety,  sabbe bhadrāni passantu, mā kañci pāpam-āgamā. [04] may all see prosperity, may nothing bad come to anyone.     Appamāṇo Buddho! The Buddha is measureless!  Appamāṇo Dhammo! The Dhamma is measureless!  Appamāṇo Saṅgho! The Saṅgha is measureless!     Pamāṇavantāni siriṁsapāni, ahivicchikā, satapadī, uṇṇānābhi, sarabū, mūsikā. Measurable are creeping things, (such as) snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, and rats.  Katā me rakkhā, katā me parittā, paṭikkamantu bhūtāni! I have made this protection, I have made this safeguard, may (all these) beings go away!  Sohaṁ namo Bhagavato, namo sattannaṁ Sammāsambuddhānan”-ti. I revere the Fortunate One, I revere the seven Perfect Sambuddhas.”

{{< video-card id="MCKvog08RCc" title="How To Lose Weight As A Buddhist Monk" date="2024-03-16" >}}
I recently lost about 10 Kg which is over 20 pounds.  I'd like to share with you how I gained weight and how I also lost it. We talk about the troubles of being a senior monk, Buddhist Monk rules (vinaya), Buddhist Monk reflections on eating, and habits.  Lastly, we talk about how the  difference between the difficulty in losing weight compared to the ending of all suffering.  In short there is no comparison.
