I will be going to the USA in a few days.  I was thinking of all of the anger that is on the left these days.  When the left is in control, it is the opposite.  Loving-kindness is a good thing and should be practiced often.

{{< video-card id="WFfKDczVkM8" title="Protections, Leaches, Monks and Khandha Paritta" date="2025-03-19" >}}
Update March 19, Protections, Leaches, Monks and Khandha Paritta.  Here is a small \"walk and talk\" update while on my way for alms.  This time, I had a friend who came with me and was willing to film me while I talked.     (Ven Anandajoti translation.) “Virūpakkhehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Erāpathehi me, “I am friendly with the Virūpakkhas, with the Erāpathas I am friendly,  Chabyāputtehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Kaṇhāgotamakehi ca. [01] I am friendly with the Chabyāputtas, and friendly with the Kaṇhāgotamakas.     Apādakehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ dipādakehi me, I am friendly with those without feet, with those with two feet I am friendly,  catuppadehi  me mettaṁ, mettaṁ bahuppadehi me. [02] I am friendly with those with four feet, with those with many feet I am friendly.     Mā maṁ apādako hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi dipādako, May the one without feet not hurt me, may the one with two feet not hurt me,  mā maṁ catuppado hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi bahuppado. [03] may the one with four feet not hurt me, may the one with many feet not hurt me.     Sabbe sattā, sabbe pāṇā, sabbe bhūtā ca kevalā, May all beings, all living creatures, all who are born, in their entirety,  sabbe bhadrāni passantu, mā kañci pāpam-āgamā. [04] may all see prosperity, may nothing bad come to anyone.     Appamāṇo Buddho! The Buddha is measureless!  Appamāṇo Dhammo! The Dhamma is measureless!  Appamāṇo Saṅgho! The Saṅgha is measureless!     Pamāṇavantāni siriṁsapāni, ahivicchikā, satapadī, uṇṇānābhi, sarabū, mūsikā. Measurable are creeping things, (such as) snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, and rats.  Katā me rakkhā, katā me parittā, paṭikkamantu bhūtāni! I have made this protection, I have made this safeguard, may (all these) beings go away!  Sohaṁ namo Bhagavato, namo sattannaṁ Sammāsambuddhānan”-ti. I revere the Fortunate One, I revere the seven Perfect Sambuddhas.”

{{< video-card id="MCKvog08RCc" title="How To Lose Weight As A Buddhist Monk" date="2024-03-16" >}}
I recently lost about 10 Kg which is over 20 pounds.  I'd like to share with you how I gained weight and how I also lost it. We talk about the troubles of being a senior monk, Buddhist Monk rules (vinaya), Buddhist Monk reflections on eating, and habits.  Lastly, we talk about how the  difference between the difficulty in losing weight compared to the ending of all suffering.  In short there is no comparison.

{{< video-card id="V-g_SHk5Wp4" title="How to Make a Monk Water Filter in 3 Minutes" date="2017-10-10" >}}
Here is a quick tip on how to make a filter in just a few minutes.  Maybe as fast as one minute.  This is useful for monks who want to put filters on their water taps.  It is my own invention as far as I know, but I am sure other monks somewhere else also do the same.  The Buddha did mention that if we did not have a filter, we could use the corner of our robes (that we are wearing).  This was how I got the idea by using an old robe.  Old robes are abundant and easy to find in almost any monastery.  Be sure to clean the robe before officially using the filter.  This one was washed twice, but still had a stain on it.  If you are really lazy (like me), you can cut out the filter and then just wash that small piece of cloth in a very short time.  If you are a lay person, it might be interesting to see the commercial strength bowl washing sink where we wash our bowls.  3:15 minutes in length.  Enjoy!

A Powerpoint presentation about what two monks did in Kauai, Hawaii during June to December 2015.  The theme was propagation, but the propagation was done just from being monks who do not touch money, and collect their food the traditional Buddhism monk way.

{{< video-card id="MFl08DBa7Vw" title="Knowing and Seeing, Pa Auk Forest Monastery HD version" date="2015-10-27" >}}
Life at the Pa-Auk Forest Monastery in Mawlamyine, Myanmar.  This version was built from the DVD version.  All other YouTube versions (that I know of are built from the Vcd  low resolution.  I originally made this video for my brother in 2005 from a silent 55 minute video shot by the England group in 2003.  If you think this video is long winded for people with long attention spans...uh.. you better look at the original.  As I was doing an audio comment, \"um this is the clinic.\" a friend told me to add some background noises.  Later came a script with a \"narrator's voice.\" (which some do not like, but it was the best I could do.).
