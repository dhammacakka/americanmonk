{{< video-card id="2diSbujtI8M" title="Alms In Florida?" date="2024-12-06" >}}
A recollection about how I went for Buddhist alms (piṇḍapāta) in a very small Christian town of Geneva, Florida.  We discuss the method of going for alms and using mettā or Loving-kindness as a basis for going for alms, to make it a meditation, and to make one safe and approachable.  I enjoyed this time.  It inspired myself and I hope it inspires you too.

{{< video-card id="yh2zsBiBn_Y" title="About Sri Lanka Alms (piṇḍapāta):   A Talk On Piṇḍapāta With Video Footage" date="2024-06-16" >}}
Here we talk about what it is like to go for alms in Sri Lanka versus other countries.  Several pictures and videos of actual alms are shown.   Any country can be modified to go individually and get the proper proportions of food, but often in Myanmar, it is a group activity.  I feel blessed to be able to experience the alms in Sri Lanka, and how I'm able to help people make merit while making merit myself. Piṇḍapāta is a great experience for the monk life.  I hope you can benefit from this talk.

This is a video of most of the photo collection by the lay yogi named Brahm.  He is quite a good photographer.  It shows how food is cooked for 1200 Yogis (monks, nuns, laypeople) who live and meditate at Pa-Auk Meditation Center.  There are also pictures of the female meditation hall.  (near the kitchen but 1 mile from the monk's area).

{{< video-card id="ciI3W3ZVoBU" title="Getting Food Pa-Auk Mawlamyine" date="2019-06-25" >}}
This is what it is like for a monk to go through the alms food line at Pa-Auk Main Center, Mawlamyine, Myanmar.   It is not easy to manage so many donors with big hearts to give.  Most of the time, I am giving hand signals to get less food.  You will also notice that I do not open the bowl cover until they make a smaller portion.  The nun with the cup of soupy-rice always tries to put \"a small portion of the cup\" in my bowl everyday.  However, I always make her pour out most of it before I open my bowl lid.  This is a daily exchange.  You might want to play this at double speed.  However, this is a real time video and you can get a feel for what it is like to go in the line.  There are often 300 to 400 monks waiting in line to get to this point too.   Do you like this.. Subscribe to: https://AmericanMonk.org
