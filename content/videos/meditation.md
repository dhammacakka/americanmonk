{{< video-card id="jAl9_gosDPw" title="How To Sit longer (quick guide)" date="2025-11-05" >}}
Many people are interested in learning how they can increase their sitting times — what exercises they can do, what kind of stretches they can do — so they can sit longer.  Here is a simple idea.  This is a meditation seat. There is an angled pillow with medium rubber foam at about a 30-degree angle, which is ideal.  And then, in front, I have what is called a bed laptop desk.  This helps you get used to sitting on your meditation seat, but you can still do your work whenever you need to work.  So instead of only getting one hour or two hours of practice time to stretch your tendons in the meditation posture, you can sit on your meditation seat while doing your work — and your legs will slowly get used to the meditation posture.

{{< video-card id="dhMxEu9vaZY" title="Dont Wear Shoes" date="2025-11-04" >}}
When you sit on the floor, it’s very important that you don’t wear your shoes inside the house, or at least the room where you sit on the floor. That’s very important because when you sit on the floor, the floor becomes your furniture.  And if you’ve had a good mother or good father, they tell you don’t put your shoes on the furniture, right? So you want to have the floor nice and clean. It’s very important that you have a space where you don’t wear your shoes.  In Asia, very few people wear their shoes inside the house. They take the shoes off. You don’t want to bring the outside world into your house, or into your meditation room, or your work room.  After you do this for a while, you think it’s sort of dirty to actually bring your shoes inside the house. So I hope you can also practice this, and make your place more sacred, and make your place more clean.  — Bhante Subhuti

{{< video-card id="2diSbujtI8M" title="Alms In Florida?" date="2024-12-06" >}}
A recollection about how I went for Buddhist alms (piṇḍapāta) in a very small Christian town of Geneva, Florida.  We discuss the method of going for alms and using mettā or Loving-kindness as a basis for going for alms, to make it a meditation, and to make one safe and approachable.  I enjoyed this time.  It inspired myself and I hope it inspires you too.

{{< video-card id="aP6PmFICOb8" title="How To Know The Qualities Needed For Meditation" date="2024-08-18" >}}
In this video we talk about the qualities needed for the development of meditation.  These qualities are listed in the first 3 stanzas of the Metta Sutta.  It is not just for Loving-Kindness but for all types of meditation. Because not many people are interested in traditionally taught Theravāda loving-kindness meditation, these qualities are often overlooked.  In this hour-long talk, we discuss all of the qualities listed in this sutta.  May you learn from these qualities and apply them to your practice so you can attain Nibbāna safely and quickly.  0:00 introduction 3:21 Chanting 3 verses 6:56 First Verse Skilled in good... 8:30 Right Livelihood 17:07 Second Verse Being Able ... 22:40 easy to talk to 24:50 soft (story of driving in car) 32:30 putrid cow urine as medicine 36:01 easy to support (monk in airport) 41:58 to be light in duty (story of father and brother) 52:41 restraint in faculties 53:38  greedy for families (donors) 57:12 conclusion: What we talked about

{{< video-card id="O4MYS9xg9ts" title="Benefits of Alms (last 5 minutes of Giving alms again and again)" date="2024-07-31" >}}
Benefits of Alms (last 5 minutes of Giving alms again and again). In this talk, I explain the benefits of going for alms, often with the hardships one faces.  Not that it is wished for, but how one deals with it.  It is the hard times where growth can come.  Further benefits, are appreciation of food, easy to support, meditation, gratitude, and making merit by being a prop for others to make merit as well as the opportunity to share with others from one's own bowl.

{{< video-card id="OXL1voHEd5g" title="Why Was The Earth Kasiṇa Taught First? #meditation #kasina #buddha #earth" date="2024-06-23" >}}
It might be a mystery as to why the Earth Kasina was taught first in the great and ancient meditation manual called the Visuddhimagga.  Here, in this short video, you can see that we sometimes forget what it was like during the time of the Buddha.

{{< video-card id="Mt69hMPiaFA" title="Bhante Subhuti 2003:  What caused you to be Buddhist and a Monk?" date="2024-06-08" >}}
I recently found this DVD and extracted the MP4 from it.  Then I extracted the \"story\" of how I became a monk.  This is actually old information if you have been following my posts.  However, this is from 20 years ago.  It gives a glimpse of what the kuti was like and how I was at the time.  At the very end, I was so grateful to the fact that I made it as a monk that I began to cry.  However, the interview was cut at that point for privacy reasons.  This is actually a book called Going For Broke:  Travelogs on Becoming A Buddhist Monk  \"I once had a visitor from America. He brought a video camera with him and asked me the David Byrne Question, \"Well, how did I get here?\" So I proceeded to tell him the story about how I first got turned on to meditation, how I decided to leave my job, the watch story, the Sai Babba slipper story, WPN and of course The Ordination Story.   I completed the 30 minute saga with the phrase \"So…Here I am Bhikkhu Subhūti!\" while stroking the robes that I was wearing. I then thought about how I would explain the different adventures that I've had and all the exciting things I've done and then say that this experience has surely been the best.   So I followed that thought and started to say, \"You know…I've done a lot of …\" but something happened at that moment. A big lump formed in my throat and I felt my eyes start to well up. I couldn't go on much longer. I cut everything short and finished abruptly with, \"… But this has made me the most happy!\" with a quivering voice. At this time, tears were falling down my face and I couldn't speak any more. I couldn't even tell the person who was filming me to stop. I could only wave my hand and do some \"cut\" director sign language to tell him to stop.\"

This is a video of most of the photo collection by the lay yogi named Brahm.  He is quite a good photographer.  It shows how food is cooked for 1200 Yogis (monks, nuns, laypeople) who live and meditate at Pa-Auk Meditation Center.  There are also pictures of the female meditation hall.  (near the kitchen but 1 mile from the monk's area).

{{< video-card id="7LfvDocA3fI" title="Monk's Using Money - Why Is It So Bad?  (Excerpt from Interview 3)" date="2019-06-22" >}}
This is small excerpt from an interview with Nikita my old friend who used to be a monk with me.  He asked me why I spoke so strongly about monks using money.  This was my answer.  In short, the unwholesome kamma of breaking the rules adds up really quickly.  It is different from breaking a simple one time rule.  As long as money or objects bought with money are held and used, one accumulates many repeated offenses very quickly, too difficult to count.  If one eats at the wrong time, he incurs a single offense for every time he swallows.  What more can be said about using things bought with money, even a house, or a refinished floor that is not allowed?..  .  Drop by drop the cup fills up... and it fills up quickly.    This is why Ven. Pa-Auk Saydawgyi does not visit Theravada monasteries where \"normal\" monks stay.  \"Normal\" monks collect money and then build their monasteries, in addition to putting it in their personal bank accounts.  The whole monastery is not allowable.  \"One offense for every footstep\" is often quoted from the Buddha by Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadawgyi.  If his junior meditation teachers actually asked Sayadawgyi for permission to go to such monasteries, Ven. Pa-auk Sayadawgyi would never give direct permission.  He would simply restate and remind the teacher or student about the rule that is being broken and how many offenses would accumulate.  He would neither say yes or no and the one who asked would get a clear message not go visit such a monastery.  Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadawgyi rarely says no, yet that  is how he says \"No.\" Original video (over one hour) is found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUInyERnZmc

{{< video-card id="iSTu8j2urnY" title="Acapella Inertia" date="2019-06-15" >}}
This is a story about a two people who fell in love. While they spontaneously started to dance outside of a Grateful Dead Show,, they found themselves dancing even after the music had stopped, hence the title \"A'capella Inertia\".  The story goes further to relate how meditation might be related to that experience.
