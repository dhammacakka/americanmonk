{{< video-card id="aP6PmFICOb8" title="How To Know The Qualities Needed For Meditation" date="2024-08-18" >}}
In this video we talk about the qualities needed for the development of meditation.  These qualities are listed in the first 3 stanzas of the Metta Sutta.

Because not many people are interested in traditionally taught Theravāda loving-kindness meditation, these qualities are often overlooked.  In this hour-long talk, we discuss all of the qualities listed in this sutta.  May you learn from these qualities and apply them to your practice so you can attain Nibbāna safely and quickly.  0:00 introduction 3:21 Chanting 3 verses 6:56 First Verse Skilled in good... 8:30 Right Livelihood 17:07 Second Verse Being Able ... 22:40 easy to talk to 24:50 soft (story of driving in car) 32:30 putrid cow urine as medicine 36:01 easy to support (monk in airport) 41:58 to be light in duty (story of father and brother) 52:41 restraint in faculties 53:38  greedy for families (donors) 57:12 conclusion: What we talked about
