{{< video-card id="Mt69hMPiaFA" title="Bhante Subhuti 2003:  What caused you to be Buddhist and a Monk?" date="2024-06-08" >}}
I recently found this DVD and extracted the MP4 from it.  Then I extracted the \"story\" of how I became a monk.  This is actually old information if you have been following my posts.  However, this is from 20 years ago.  It gives a glimpse of what the kuti was like and how I was at the time.  At the very end, I was so grateful to the fact that I made it as a monk that I began to cry.  However, the interview was cut at that point for privacy reasons.  This is actually a book called Going For Broke:  Travelogs on Becoming A Buddhist Monk  \"I once had a visitor from America. He brought a video camera with him and asked me the David Byrne Question, \"Well, how did I get here?\" So I proceeded to tell him the story about how I first got turned on to meditation, how I decided to leave my job, the watch story, the Sai Babba slipper story, WPN and of course The Ordination Story.   I completed the 30 minute saga with the phrase \"So…Here I am Bhikkhu Subhūti!\" while stroking the robes that I was wearing. I then thought about how I would explain the different adventures that I've had and all the exciting things I've done and then say that this experience has surely been the best.   So I followed that thought and started to say, \"You know…I've done a lot of …\" but something happened at that moment. A big lump formed in my throat and I felt my eyes start to well up. I couldn't go on much longer. I cut everything short and finished abruptly with, \"… But this has made me the most happy!\" with a quivering voice. At this time, tears were falling down my face and I couldn't speak any more. I couldn't even tell the person who was filming me to stop. I could only wave my hand and do some \"cut\" director sign language to tell him to stop.\"
