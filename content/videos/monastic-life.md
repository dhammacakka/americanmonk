Summary: When monks chant blessings, we’re reminding you of cause and effect. Dana is already wholesome — because there is non-greed and non-anger present in the moment of giving. But when you give with wisdom — knowing the cause… knowing the effect… it becomes triple-rooted. Alobha, adosa, and amoha (paññā). This is why intention matters. Giving with wisdom multiplies the power of merit.  Transcription: What's special that happens when we give the blessing? The thing is that we're reminding you about cause and effect so that we can add paññā, wisdom, to the quality of the donation. When you give, there's always alobha, adosa. This means non-greed, non-hatred, non-anger. So alobha, adosa, non-greed, non-anger. So these are wholesome things because they're the opposite of greed and anger because it's never present when you're giving a gift. Even if you're angry before, at that moment you're giving, at least you might not be happy, but there will be a neutral feeling associated with that. And then you might go back to being angry at someone. We always say that if you're angry at someone, give them a gift. But in any case, it's always a wholesome mind. But sometimes a lot of times you give and you're not thinking about cause and effect. And not only that, you might not be thinking about being respectful. And so when we do that chant, actually people are like this, they're very, very respectful when we give this chant. And so they're thinking about cause and effect and they're being respectful. And of course these four qualities will come. And triple-rooted, we say. Triple-rooted. Aloba, adosa, amoha. Amoha is the same as paññā. It means wisdom.

{{< video-card id="inmZadIG_Kc" title="Alms during Halloween, USA" date="2025-11-02" >}}
From httpa://americanmonk.org People thought we were trick-or-treaters and gave candy, but it turned into one of the best alms days.  One time I was in Kauai with one of my senior friends. I think it was 2015. We would go for alms, and we would wish loving-kindness in front of each house — not too long, not too short — just enough time so they could look outside, see who we were, and we could radiate mettā.  A lady finally came out and said, “Oh… what do we have here?” Almost like you might say to kids going trick-or-treating. Eventually she understood we were actually monks… but she still gave us Halloween candy.  That day actually became one of our best days in terms of getting food from the local houses. The Thai community also regularly came to where we walked — they always knew which roads we would be on and offered alms frequently. The local American people… sometimes yes, sometimes no. But on Halloween day — we definitely received a lot of candy.  And of course — this was during proper alms round time… not at night.

{{< video-card id="hXzpUvPYxn8" title="Three Major Karmas For Next Life" date="2025-10-29" >}}
Three Major Karmas for Next Life  There are three major factors that contribute to the near-death moment — the moment just before death — which decide how you are born in the next life.  The weight of the kamma  The frequency of the kamma  The proximity to death — how recent or fresh the kamma is in your mind  These three conditions can determine how the results of one’s kamma will manifest in the next life, in the future khandhas (groups of existence).  The reason I originally wrote about this was because of a terrible accident in Seoul, South Korea, in 2022. There was a kind of stampede — a massive crowd where the people in front couldn’t move while those behind continued to push forward. Many suffocated and were trampled to death.  It was during a Halloween festival, and people were dressed in costumes — goblins, death zombies, or serial killers. Can you imagine dying in such a situation, dressed as one of those things? That proximity to death coming to fruition under such unpleasant conditions is very dangerous.  It’s an unpleasant way to die — dressed up as a goblin or whatever. It’s very terrible.  I remember in Na Uyana we had one lady who offered food to the monks. Just moments after she gave the meal, she passed away. She came to the monastery, gave the offering, and then died shortly after.  It’s not something to laugh about — I was just thinking about cause and effect when smiling.  She died just moments after her meritorious act of dāna (generosity). We never want anyone to die, of course. Please try to live as long as possible. But we might guess that there were favorable conditions for her next life.

{{< video-card id="P0RTAuCNcSQ" title="Pātimokkha Mystical Purification?" date="2025-08-03" >}}
Here we discuss the misconception that there is some mystical purification process that happens during the pātimokkha.  Although the monk is pure when he leaves the pātimokkha, it is merely because he confessed his offences beforehand and he attended the pātimokkha (something he is supposed to do).  There is nothing magical.  Theravāda is about kamma and doing the right things.

I thought I would talk about how monasteries do construction in order to give hope that the monks and the lay people will be able to rebuild.  It will be a hardship for sure, but there is a good chance for merit to accrue.

{{< video-card id="yh2zsBiBn_Y" title="About Sri Lanka Alms (piṇḍapāta):   A Talk On Piṇḍapāta With Video Footage" date="2024-06-16" >}}
Here we talk about what it is like to go for alms in Sri Lanka versus other countries.  Several pictures and videos of actual alms are shown.   Any country can be modified to go individually and get the proper proportions of food, but often in Myanmar, it is a group activity.  I feel blessed to be able to experience the alms in Sri Lanka, and how I'm able to help people make merit while making merit myself. Piṇḍapāta is a great experience for the monk life.  I hope you can benefit from this talk.

{{< video-card id="n8MnRmZzrxM" title="3 Stories Of Loving-kindness" date="2024-01-13" >}}
3 Stories of Lovingkindness.  The first story is from Kaua'i, Hawai'i, when a person did not want me on \"his\" street.  Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed.  Another story was also from the island, in 2015 when children on bicycles were yelling at us to go away.  Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed.  The last story is from 2011 during a trip to India.  The loving-kindness did not change the other, but a different outcome was the result.  The lady probably did not say, \"If you have Jesus in your heart, then you do not need to collect food.\"  I might be confusing it with another story from 2006 when I was going for alms in New Britain, CT.  Perhaps I'll tell that story later.  It is mentioned in my book Going For Broke: Travelogs on becoming a Buddhist monk.

{{< video-card id="HRGdqb-8qic" title="Pa-Auk Pouring Concrete" date="2020-08-19" >}}
Workers are not with us during lock-down.  So it was time to pour concrete the old fashion way for the Junior Monks' Pathway under the new rain cover for rainy season.  This way the junior monks won't get wet after they collect their food.   The work is quite tiring.  I did some work shovelling rocks and I was completely tired after only one hour.  The work started after lunch and continued into the night until about 7:30 pm.  The nun doing the final pouring at the end of the fire-line is Daw Gunagavesi.  She is a Myanmar medical doctor and in charge of the kitchen staff.

{{< video-card id="ciI3W3ZVoBU" title="Getting Food Pa-Auk Mawlamyine" date="2019-06-25" >}}
This is what it is like for a monk to go through the alms food line at Pa-Auk Main Center, Mawlamyine, Myanmar.   It is not easy to manage so many donors with big hearts to give.  Most of the time, I am giving hand signals to get less food.  You will also notice that I do not open the bowl cover until they make a smaller portion.  The nun with the cup of soupy-rice always tries to put \"a small portion of the cup\" in my bowl everyday.  However, I always make her pour out most of it before I open my bowl lid.  This is a daily exchange.  You might want to play this at double speed.  However, this is a real time video and you can get a feel for what it is like to go in the line.  There are often 300 to 400 monks waiting in line to get to this point too.   Do you like this.. Subscribe to: https://AmericanMonk.org

How to make a monk's needle case from an old pen.  It takes a few minutes and all you need is a candle and a used up pen with a front pen tip cover that screws off. This is one of the few things I can make myself and donate to other monks without asking my donors to do the job.

{{< video-card id="V-g_SHk5Wp4" title="How to Make a Monk Water Filter in 3 Minutes" date="2017-10-10" >}}
Here is a quick tip on how to make a filter in just a few minutes.  Maybe as fast as one minute.  This is useful for monks who want to put filters on their water taps.  It is my own invention as far as I know, but I am sure other monks somewhere else also do the same.  The Buddha did mention that if we did not have a filter, we could use the corner of our robes (that we are wearing).  This was how I got the idea by using an old robe.  Old robes are abundant and easy to find in almost any monastery.  Be sure to clean the robe before officially using the filter.  This one was washed twice, but still had a stain on it.  If you are really lazy (like me), you can cut out the filter and then just wash that small piece of cloth in a very short time.  If you are a lay person, it might be interesting to see the commercial strength bowl washing sink where we wash our bowls.  3:15 minutes in length.  Enjoy!
