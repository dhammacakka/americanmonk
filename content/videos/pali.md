3:37min   Here we retell the Dog Duty Ascetic Sutta from the Majjhima Nikāya, where an ascetic imitates a dog seeking heavenly rebirth. The Buddha reveals that such conduct only leads to rebirth among dogs.  We conclude urging instead the cultivation of genuine virtue and the pursuit of Nibbāna.  Transcript: There was a famous sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya called The Dog Duty Ascetic. There was an ascetic named Bhūna who came to the Buddha and asked, “Bhante, what would be the fruit of my practice?”  This ascetic acted like a dog all the time—he walked like a dog, ate like a dog, and lived as a dog. That was his practice. He had been following it faithfully, believing it would bring him to the heavenly realms.  The Buddha replied, “Don’t ask me this question.” The reason, the Buddha said, is that he only speaks what is true, beneficial, and timely. The Buddha always speaks the truth, but only when it is beneficial and at the right time.  Sometimes the truth may not be sweet or pleasant—especially when speaking to someone whose practice may lead to unfortunate results. The Buddha told the ascetic, “If you do this practice perfectly, the best that can happen is that you will be reborn among dogs.”  Now, in America, the dog’s life is quite different from the dog’s life in Asia. Some people even wish to be dogs! I have a friend who once said he wanted to be reborn as a dog because he has two dogs living on a nine-acre botanical garden estate in Kaua‘i. He said, “If I could come back as one of my dogs, that would be great!”  But people don’t know what it’s like for dogs in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, or Laos. In many parts of the world, the dog’s life is harsh. Even in America, where there are animal shelters, many dogs are still killed every year.  The Buddha said that if one performs such a practice with the wrong view—believing that acting like a dog will bring heavenly rebirth—this wrong view and wrong action lead instead to the lower realms, even below the animal realms, into the hell realms.  So my recommendation is this: live a good life every day. Embody wholesome character. Be a “goodie goodie.” Be a little angel in your mind. Always do the right thing. Don’t put on a costume—embody goodness from within.  If you act like an angel, that is what you become. But be an angel who uses that goodness for the purpose of reaching Nibbāna. Always wish for the conditions to reach Nibbāna.  Be good. Be kind. Be someone others naturally describe as “such an angel.” Whether it comes naturally or takes effort—make that effort.

{{< video-card id="kx9Wf_v2HsU" title="How to Pronounce The Buddha" date="2025-03-24" >}}
This is a video about how to pronounce \"The Buddha\" according to the authentic international Pāḷi pronunciation.  It is different from the American way to pronounce.  The focus is on aspirated consonants, like \"dha\".     Most of you already know, but some of you do not.  I was inspired to make this video a long time ago when my sister I discussed this and I finally got around to making it.  You can share this video with your friends if you like it...And I do hope you enjoy this.  Disclaimer.. as an American, I'm sure mispronounce things often and I probably will still make mistakes!

Is There A Creator In Buddhism?  The creator is kamma.  We will explore briefly this statement.  We are born from kamma, created from kamma, whatever we do, good or bad, for that we will inherit.  There is a small mention of the culakammavibhanga sutta and inferring about past lives.

Mahayana has a different definition of a  Bodhisatva than the Theravada Bodhisatta (Pali Language).  I explain this difference and I also emphasize that there is a Buddha Path in the Theravada School (also known as Hinayana).  However, because it is so difficult, it is not often encouraged.
