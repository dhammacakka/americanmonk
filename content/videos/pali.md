3:37min   Here we retell the Dog Duty Ascetic Sutta from the Majjhima Nikāya, where an ascetic imitates a dog seeking heavenly rebirth. The Buddha reveals that such conduct only leads to rebirth among dogs.  We conclude urging instead the cultivation of genuine virtue and the pursuit of Nibbāna.  Transcript: There was a famous sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya called The Dog Duty Ascetic. There was an ascetic named Bhūna who came to the Buddha and asked, “Bhante, what would be the fruit of my practice?”  This ascetic acted like a dog all the time—he walked like a dog, ate like a dog, and lived as a dog. That was his practice. He had been following it faithfully, believing it would bring him to the heavenly realms.  The Buddha replied, “Don’t ask me this question.” The reason, the Buddha said, is that he only speaks what is true, beneficial, and timely. The Buddha always speaks the truth, but only when it is beneficial and at the right time.  Sometimes the truth may not be sweet or pleasant—especially when speaking to someone whose practice may lead to unfortunate results. The Buddha told the ascetic, “If you do this practice perfectly, the best that can happen is that you will be reborn among dogs.”  Now, in America, the dog’s life is quite different from the dog’s life in Asia. Some people even wish to be dogs! I have a friend who once said he wanted to be reborn as a dog because he has two dogs living on a nine-acre botanical garden estate in Kaua‘i. He said, “If I could come back as one of my dogs, that would be great!”  But people don’t know what it’s like for dogs in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, or Laos. In many parts of the world, the dog’s life is harsh. Even in America, where there are animal shelters, many dogs are still killed every year.  The Buddha said that if one performs such a practice with the wrong view—believing that acting like a dog will bring heavenly rebirth—this wrong view and wrong action lead instead to the lower realms, even below the animal realms, into the hell realms.  So my recommendation is this: live a good life every day. Embody wholesome character. Be a “goodie goodie.” Be a little angel in your mind. Always do the right thing. Don’t put on a costume—embody goodness from within.  If you act like an angel, that is what you become. But be an angel who uses that goodness for the purpose of reaching Nibbāna. Always wish for the conditions to reach Nibbāna.  Be good. Be kind. Be someone others naturally describe as “such an angel.” Whether it comes naturally or takes effort—make that effort.

{{< video-card id="lx1ZUvFxptI" title="Next Life Costume" date="2025-10-29" >}}
A short Dhamma reflection on the subtle power of intention — even in something as simple as a Halloween costume. When we take on a role, we embody it; when we make a wish, we shape our future. This talk reminds us to be mindful of what we imitate and what we wish for, because the mind transforms with every thought, action, and aspiration.  Transcription:  And even if you have a wholesome costume one year, you might end up with an unwholesome costume the next year. And that's why it's a bad habit. You might be the good fairy one year, and then the next year, death zombie. So this is not very good, not very good at all to do. Because when one acts, one is transforming their mind and body, they're embodying that character if they're really good. And when one dresses up, one makes a conscious or unconscious wish to have that come true.  And anyone who has done the Dichu Samapada the correct way according to the commentaries — knowing about the past lives, the present life, and what could happen in the future — they would tell you, be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it.  And so when you wish for something, it's like — how does that give you a new life? How does that result in a new life? But the problem is, when you paint a picture in the sky, it doesn't work. You need a medium to paint on.  So when you wish to operate on someone, you might become a doctor. If you wish you could kill someone, you imagine yourself killing someone, you might end up as that same person who kills someone.

Here is another \"Walk and Talk\" video and update.  Here, I talk about my progress in learning the Pāḷi language and also the benefit of reading Pāḷi which can slow one down.  I also talk about the benefits of repeating the very same Dhamma over and over again.  There is a lot one can learn, but putting the very basics into full practice is the most difficult part.

Update March 19, Protections, Leaches, Monks and Khandha Paritta.  Here is a small \"walk and talk\" update while on my way for alms.  This time, I had a friend who came with me and was willing to film me while I talked.     (Ven Anandajoti translation.) “Virūpakkhehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Erāpathehi me, “I am friendly with the Virūpakkhas, with the Erāpathas I am friendly,  Chabyāputtehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Kaṇhāgotamakehi ca. [01] I am friendly with the Chabyāputtas, and friendly with the Kaṇhāgotamakas.     Apādakehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ dipādakehi me, I am friendly with those without feet, with those with two feet I am friendly,  catuppadehi  me mettaṁ, mettaṁ bahuppadehi me. [02] I am friendly with those with four feet, with those with many feet I am friendly.     Mā maṁ apādako hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi dipādako, May the one without feet not hurt me, may the one with two feet not hurt me,  mā maṁ catuppado hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi bahuppado. [03] may the one with four feet not hurt me, may the one with many feet not hurt me.     Sabbe sattā, sabbe pāṇā, sabbe bhūtā ca kevalā, May all beings, all living creatures, all who are born, in their entirety,  sabbe bhadrāni passantu, mā kañci pāpam-āgamā. [04] may all see prosperity, may nothing bad come to anyone.     Appamāṇo Buddho! The Buddha is measureless!  Appamāṇo Dhammo! The Dhamma is measureless!  Appamāṇo Saṅgho! The Saṅgha is measureless!     Pamāṇavantāni siriṁsapāni, ahivicchikā, satapadī, uṇṇānābhi, sarabū, mūsikā. Measurable are creeping things, (such as) snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, and rats.  Katā me rakkhā, katā me parittā, paṭikkamantu bhūtāni! I have made this protection, I have made this safeguard, may (all these) beings go away!  Sohaṁ namo Bhagavato, namo sattannaṁ Sammāsambuddhānan”-ti. I revere the Fortunate One, I revere the seven Perfect Sambuddhas.”

In this Dhammapada verse 118, I again discuss the benefits of giving again and again.  Not only that, I tell the story of how food containers, and a cloth bag were donated to me for the purpose giving me more food to take back home.  I hope you enjoy this story.  I wonder if I will run out of stories to tell?  But here they are.  I'd like to document some of these touching stories mostly for my self, but to inspire others in the monk life.

In this video, I speak about the determinations made during chanting to only follow the Triple Gem as a refuge and no other.  This is a determination not only for life, but for the end of Samsara.  In the end, I use the power of my own story as a Western Monk and how it is definitely likely that I have made such oaths before, using the power of logic.   Notes:  HOMAGE TO THE BUDDHA (Buddha-vandanā)  Iti'pi so Bhagavā Arahaṁ, Sammā-sambuddho, Vijjā-caraṇa-sampanno, Sugato, Loka-vidū, Anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi, Satthādeva-manussānam, Buddho, Bhagavā'ti.   Thus indeed, is that Blessed One, an Arahant (entirely free from defilements, a worthy one), Fully enlightened [by his own effort], endowed with knowledge and [good] conduct, Who has fared well (i.e. gone the correct path), Knower of the worlds, Incomparable trainer of those who are tamable, Teacher of deities and men, Awakened [from the sleep of ignorance] and Blessed [with good fortune].  Buddhaṁ jīvita-pariyantaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.  Until life's end, I go to the Buddha for refuge.  Ye ca Buddhā atītā ca - ye ca Buddhā anāgatā,  Paccuppannā ca ye Buddhā - ahaṁ vandāmi sabbadā.  Daily I venerate (pay respects to) the Buddhas of the past, the Buddhas of the future and the Buddhas of the present.  N'atthi me saraṇaṁ aññaṁ - Buddho me saraṇaṁ varaṁ,  Etena   sacca-vajjena  -  hotu   me   jaya-maṅgalaṁ.  There is no other refuge for me, the Buddha is my supreme refuge, by this assertion (lit. speaking) of truth may there be victory and prosperity for me.  Uttamaṅgena vande'haṁ - pāda-paṁsu-varuttamaṁ,   Buddhe yo khalito doso - Buddho khamatu taṁ mamaṁ.  I [bow and] pay respects with [my] head at the dust on the feet of the Supreme Great One. [If] I have [committed] any erring or wrongdoing towards the Buddha, may the Awakened One forgive me for that.  HOMAGE TO THE DHAMMA (Dhamma-vandanā)  Svākkhāto Bhagavatā Dhammo, Sandhiṭṭhiko, Akāliko, Ehi-passiko, Opanayiko, Paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhī'ti. The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, to be realized in this [very] life, with immediate results, inviting investigation, leading to Nibbāna and to be experienced personally by the wise.  Dhammaṁ jīvita-pariyantaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.  Until life's end, I go to the Dhamma for refuge.  Ye ca Dhammā atītā ca - ye ca Dhammā anāgatā,  Paccuppannā ca ye Dhammā - ahaṁ vandāmi sabbadā.  Daily I venerate (pay respects to) the Dhammas of the past, the Dhammas of the future and the Dhammas of the present.  N'atthi me saraṇaṁ aññaṁ - Dhammo me saraṇaṁ varaṁ,  Etena   sacca-vajjena  -  hotu   me   jaya-maṅgalaṁ.  There is no other refuge for me, the Dhamma is my supreme refuge, by this assertion of truth may there be victory and prosperity for me.  Uttamaṅgena vande'ham - Dhammaṁ ca ti-vidhaṁ varaṁ,   Dhamme yo khalito doso - Dhammo khamatu taṁ mamaṁ.   I [bow and] pay respects with [my] head to the Dhamma, which is three-fold9 and supreme. [If] I have [committed] any erring or wrongdoing towards the Dhamma, may the Dhamma forgive me for that.   HOMAGE TO THE SAṄGHA (Saṅgha-vandanā)  Supaṭipanno Bhagavato sāvaka-saṅgho, Uju-paṭipanno Bhagavato sāvaka-saṅgho, Ñāya-paṭipanno Bhagavato sāvaka-saṅgho, Sāmīci-paṭipanno Bhagavato sāvaka- saṅgho, Yad-idaṁ cattāri purisa-yugāni aṭṭha purisa- puggalā, esa Bhagavato sāvaka-saṅgho, Āhuneyyo, Pāhuneyyo, Dakkhiṇeyyo, Añjali-karaṇīyo, Anuttaraṁ puññakkhettaṁ lokassā'ti. The order of the disciples of the Blessed One has practiced well, the order of the disciples of the Blessed One has practiced uprightly, the order of the disciples of the Blessed One has practised according to the right path, the order of the disciples of the Blessed One has practised in a suitable way [to attain nibbāna]; just this, i.e. the four pairs of men or the eight individuals, is the order of the disciples of the Blessed One, who are worthy to attend on, worthy to receive hospitality, worthy to receive offerings, worthy to receive salutation with palms placed together showing respect and are an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.  Saṅghaṁ jīvita-pariyantaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi.  Until life's end, I go to the Saṅgha for refuge.  Ye ca Saṅghā atītā ca - ye ca Saṅghā anāgatā,  Paccuppannā ca ye Saṅghā - ahaṁ vandāmi sabbadā.  Daily I venerate (pay respects to) the Saṅghas of the past, the Saṅghas of the future and the Saṅghas of the present.  N'atthi me saraṇaṁ aññaṁ - Saṅgho me saraṇaṁ varaṁ,  Etena   sacca-vajjena  -  hotu   me   jaya-maṅgalaṁ.  There is no other refuge for me, the Saṅgha is my supreme refuge, by this assertion of truth may there be victory and prosperity for me.  Uttamaṅgena vande'ham - Saṅghaṁ ca ti-vidhottamaṁ,  Sanghe yo khalito doso - Saṅgho khamatu taṁ mamaṁ.  I [bow and] pay respects with [my] head to the Saṅgha, which is three-fold10 and supreme. [If] I have [committed] any erring or wrongdoing towards the Saṅgha, may the Saṅgha forgive me for that.

Here is the latest from EkaSara (One Voice).  It is called Khanda Paritta.  It is half of the sutta that is found on the link below.  EkaSara plans to redo the previous chants in a similar style similar to this one and the others have been pulled from archive, except for the Metta English Mix.  https://archive.org/details/khanda-full_session .  This sutta is required to be chanted daily if the monks live in the forest.  Its main purpose is to prevent snake bites, but it includes all types of animals, 0-leg (snakes), 2 legs, 4 legs, and many legs (insects and centipedes).  It is a magic spell.  Where is the magic?  Loving-Kindness.   I usually ask which of these are the most dangerous.  Most people say snakes.  It is my belief that the  two legged creatures are some of the most dangerous animals on earth.
