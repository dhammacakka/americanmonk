I had to remove a sticky label from a flask.  I thought it would be good to give. a small video on how to remove adhesive residue simply by using oil.  You can use any type of oil.  I had coconut oil so I used that.

{{< video-card id="pGqJ_fZo5Ys" title="Loving Kindness To Your Enemies?" date="2025-04-03" >}}
I will be going to the USA in a few days.  I was thinking of all of the anger that is on the left these days.  When the left is in control, it is the opposite.  Loving-kindness is a good thing and should be practiced often.

{{< video-card id="kx9Wf_v2HsU" title="How to Pronounce The Buddha" date="2025-03-24" >}}
This is a video about how to pronounce \"The Buddha\" according to the authentic international Pāḷi pronunciation.  It is different from the American way to pronounce.  The focus is on aspirated consonants, like \"dha\".     Most of you already know, but some of you do not.  I was inspired to make this video a long time ago when my sister I discussed this and I finally got around to making it.  You can share this video with your friends if you like it...And I do hope you enjoy this.  Disclaimer.. as an American, I'm sure mispronounce things often and I probably will still make mistakes!

{{< video-card id="GBgT6_rJ1bQ" title="Memorizing The Noble Eightfold Path" date="2021-11-12" >}}
This video helps you memorize The Noble Eightfold Path.  It has come to my attention that many people who are seasoned Buddhists cannot recall all 8 factors of The Noble Eightfold Path, or do with ease.  Therefore, I have made a small video to help you memorize these ordered factors in English with ease.

{{< video-card id="MFl08DBa7Vw" title="Knowing and Seeing, Pa Auk Forest Monastery HD version" date="2015-10-27" >}}
Life at the Pa-Auk Forest Monastery in Mawlamyine, Myanmar.  This version was built from the DVD version.  All other YouTube versions (that I know of are built from the Vcd  low resolution.  I originally made this video for my brother in 2005 from a silent 55 minute video shot by the England group in 2003.  If you think this video is long winded for people with long attention spans...uh.. you better look at the original.  As I was doing an audio comment, \"um this is the clinic.\" a friend told me to add some background noises.  Later came a script with a \"narrator's voice.\" (which some do not like, but it was the best I could do.).
