{{< video-card id="hXzpUvPYxn8" title="Three Major Karmas For Next Life" date="2025-10-29" >}}
Three Major Karmas for Next Life  There are three major factors that contribute to the near-death moment — the moment just before death — which decide how you are born in the next life.  The weight of the kamma  The frequency of the kamma  The proximity to death — how recent or fresh the kamma is in your mind  These three conditions can determine how the results of one’s kamma will manifest in the next life, in the future khandhas (groups of existence).  The reason I originally wrote about this was because of a terrible accident in Seoul, South Korea, in 2022. There was a kind of stampede — a massive crowd where the people in front couldn’t move while those behind continued to push forward. Many suffocated and were trampled to death.  It was during a Halloween festival, and people were dressed in costumes — goblins, death zombies, or serial killers. Can you imagine dying in such a situation, dressed as one of those things? That proximity to death coming to fruition under such unpleasant conditions is very dangerous.  It’s an unpleasant way to die — dressed up as a goblin or whatever. It’s very terrible.  I remember in Na Uyana we had one lady who offered food to the monks. Just moments after she gave the meal, she passed away. She came to the monastery, gave the offering, and then died shortly after.  It’s not something to laugh about — I was just thinking about cause and effect when smiling.  She died just moments after her meritorious act of dāna (generosity). We never want anyone to die, of course. Please try to live as long as possible. But we might guess that there were favorable conditions for her next life.

I had to remove a sticky label from a flask.  I thought it would be good to give. a small video on how to remove adhesive residue simply by using oil.  You can use any type of oil.  I had coconut oil so I used that.

{{< video-card id="N22JSLEkTks" title="Is Learning Less Okay?" date="2025-03-27" >}}
Here is another \"Walk and Talk\" video and update.  Here, I talk about my progress in learning the Pāḷi language and also the benefit of reading Pāḷi which can slow one down.  I also talk about the benefits of repeating the very same Dhamma over and over again.  There is a lot one can learn, but putting the very basics into full practice is the most difficult part.

{{< video-card id="lwIo-QcDMvo" title="About the Dhammapada" date="2024-08-10" >}}
In this video, we talk about the book, The Dhammapada.  It is one of the most famous Buddhist books one can have on his bookshelf.  I explain some points about the book, how it is structured and the importance of it as well as the stories that go with it.   I hope you find this useful.

In this Dhammapada verse 118, I again discuss the benefits of giving again and again.  Not only that, I tell the story of how food containers, and a cloth bag were donated to me for the purpose giving me more food to take back home.  I hope you enjoy this story.  I wonder if I will run out of stories to tell?  But here they are.  I'd like to document some of these touching stories mostly for my self, but to inspire others in the monk life.

{{< video-card id="O4MYS9xg9ts" title="Benefits of Alms (last 5 minutes of Giving alms again and again)" date="2024-07-31" >}}
Benefits of Alms (last 5 minutes of Giving alms again and again). In this talk, I explain the benefits of going for alms, often with the hardships one faces.  Not that it is wished for, but how one deals with it.  It is the hard times where growth can come.  Further benefits, are appreciation of food, easy to support, meditation, gratitude, and making merit by being a prop for others to make merit as well as the opportunity to share with others from one's own bowl.

{{< video-card id="lZ1b9J0gbQM" title="About Money Rules: Ethical Support for Monks By Allowable Means" date="2024-07-13" >}}
About Money Rules: Ethical Support For Monks By Allowable Means  Description: In this educational video on the monk's rules, we explore the ethical guidelines for supporting monks without monetary donations, as outlined in the Vinaya.

We delve into the Nissaggiya Pācittiya rules, focusing on the specific precepts that guide monastic conduct related to handling money. Learn about alternative ways to offer support through kappiyas (stewards), direct and indirect prompts for necessities, and the role of gift cards in maintaining Vinaya compliance. Join us as we discuss the principles of righteous giving and how to ensure your contributions foster a pure practice for monks. Ideal for lay supporters seeking to understand and practice ethical giving in line with Theravāda Buddhist teachings.

{{< video-card id="yh2zsBiBn_Y" title="About Sri Lanka Alms (piṇḍapāta):   A Talk On Piṇḍapāta With Video Footage" date="2024-06-16" >}}
Here we talk about what it is like to go for alms in Sri Lanka versus other countries.  Several pictures and videos of actual alms are shown.   Any country can be modified to go individually and get the proper proportions of food, but often in Myanmar, it is a group activity.  I feel blessed to be able to experience the alms in Sri Lanka, and how I'm able to help people make merit while making merit myself. Piṇḍapāta is a great experience for the monk life.  I hope you can benefit from this talk.

{{< video-card id="W_GKKFPytEc" title="A Promise For The Future" date="2024-06-09" >}}
In this video, I speak about the determinations made during chanting to only follow the Triple Gem as a refuge and no other.  This is a determination not only for life, but for the end of Samsara.  In the end, I use the power of my own story as a Western Monk and how it is definitely likely that I have made such oaths before, using the power of logic.   Notes:  HOMAGE TO THE BUDDHA (Buddha-vandanā)  Iti'pi so Bhagavā Arahaṁ, Sammā-sambuddho, Vijjā-caraṇa-sampanno, Sugato, Loka-vidū, Anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi, Satthādeva-manussānam, Buddho, Bhagavā'ti.

{{< video-card id="Mt69hMPiaFA" title="Bhante Subhuti 2003:  What caused you to be Buddhist and a Monk?" date="2024-06-08" >}}
I recently found this DVD and extracted the MP4 from it.  Then I extracted the \"story\" of how I became a monk.  This is actually old information if you have been following my posts.  However, this is from 20 years ago.  It gives a glimpse of what the kuti was like and how I was at the time.  At the very end, I was so grateful to the fact that I made it as a monk that I began to cry.  However, the interview was cut at that point for privacy reasons.  This is actually a book called Going For Broke:  Travelogs on Becoming A Buddhist Monk  \"I once had a visitor from America. He brought a video camera with him and asked me the David Byrne Question, \"Well, how did I get here?\" So I proceeded to tell him the story about how I first got turned on to meditation, how I decided to leave my job, the watch story, the Sai Babba slipper story, WPN and of course The Ordination Story.   I completed the 30 minute saga with the phrase \"So…Here I am Bhikkhu Subhūti!\" while stroking the robes that I was wearing. I then thought about how I would explain the different adventures that I've had and all the exciting things I've done and then say that this experience has surely been the best.   So I followed that thought and started to say, \"You know…I've done a lot of …\" but something happened at that moment. A big lump formed in my throat and I felt my eyes start to well up. I couldn't go on much longer. I cut everything short and finished abruptly with, \"… But this has made me the most happy!\" with a quivering voice. At this time, tears were falling down my face and I couldn't speak any more. I couldn't even tell the person who was filming me to stop. I could only wave my hand and do some \"cut\" director sign language to tell him to stop.\"

I recently lost about 10 Kg which is over 20 pounds.  I'd like to share with you how I gained weight and how I also lost it. We talk about the troubles of being a senior monk, Buddhist Monk rules (vinaya), Buddhist Monk reflections on eating, and habits.  Lastly, we talk about how the  difference between the difficulty in losing weight compared to the ending of all suffering.  In short there is no comparison.

{{< video-card id="7LfvDocA3fI" title="Monk's Using Money - Why Is It So Bad?  (Excerpt from Interview 3)" date="2019-06-22" >}}
This is small excerpt from an interview with Nikita my old friend who used to be a monk with me.  He asked me why I spoke so strongly about monks using money.  This was my answer.  In short, the unwholesome kamma of breaking the rules adds up really quickly.  It is different from breaking a simple one time rule.  As long as money or objects bought with money are held and used, one accumulates many repeated offenses very quickly, too difficult to count.  If one eats at the wrong time, he incurs a single offense for every time he swallows.  What more can be said about using things bought with money, even a house, or a refinished floor that is not allowed?..  .  Drop by drop the cup fills up... and it fills up quickly.    This is why Ven. Pa-Auk Saydawgyi does not visit Theravada monasteries where \"normal\" monks stay.  \"Normal\" monks collect money and then build their monasteries, in addition to putting it in their personal bank accounts.  The whole monastery is not allowable.  \"One offense for every footstep\" is often quoted from the Buddha by Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadawgyi.  If his junior meditation teachers actually asked Sayadawgyi for permission to go to such monasteries, Ven. Pa-auk Sayadawgyi would never give direct permission.  He would simply restate and remind the teacher or student about the rule that is being broken and how many offenses would accumulate.  He would neither say yes or no and the one who asked would get a clear message not go visit such a monastery.  Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadawgyi rarely says no, yet that  is how he says \"No.\" Original video (over one hour) is found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUInyERnZmc

Here is the latest from EkaSara (One Voice).  It is called Khanda Paritta.  It is half of the sutta that is found on the link below.  EkaSara plans to redo the previous chants in a similar style similar to this one and the others have been pulled from archive, except for the Metta English Mix.  https://archive.org/details/khanda-full_session .  This sutta is required to be chanted daily if the monks live in the forest.  Its main purpose is to prevent snake bites, but it includes all types of animals, 0-leg (snakes), 2 legs, 4 legs, and many legs (insects and centipedes).  It is a magic spell.  Where is the magic?  Loving-Kindness.   I usually ask which of these are the most dangerous.  Most people say snakes.  It is my belief that the  two legged creatures are some of the most dangerous animals on earth.

This is an Ardour 5 tutorial to show how to do Automation and Sends in Ardour 5.  This is the technique to add plugin effects to only a small portion of a track rather than the whole thing. This is a supplement to the tutorial for Ardour 3 which excludes the drawing tool  which is new to Ardour 5. http://brunoruviaro.github.io/ardour3-floss-tutorial/page6/  Some mistakes are listed below.. Some of the work Ardour work can be seen on this channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCoUJXm0dAxEChyuYtDKuA  Work in Process that uses this technique can be seen here. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Uv4wlWLt9rOFliTmJOcElNOXM  Review from Ardour Team. on IRC channel -headwar-  hi bhikkhusubhuti, thats IMHO a good way to make it. watch out, in the video you say the send fader is how intense the effect applies. No ! Its a real fader, controlling the amount sent to the FX bus. The amount of effect is 100%, but the level of the send affects how much of the signal is routed from your track to your bus, hence how the fx on the bus applies -oofus- bhikkhusubhuti: General points. in your channel you should have your aux send moved to post fader not pre, and in the delay bus you should have the delay plugin before the fader. -Headwar- bhikkhusubhuti: to ass on oofus' comment, I'd not choose \"strict I/O\" for the track, to allow the stereo effect to render their results in stereo -oofus- or use a stereo bus as the aux send from the mono track will add a panner which follows the channel panner for position, then if you pan the channel left or right the delay should follow which is far more natural
