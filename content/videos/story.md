In this talk, I explore the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga Sutta and share the story of reconnecting with my first meditation teacher after nearly two decades. The focus is on the seeds of kamma that we plant continuously through our actions. What kind of seeds are we planting right now?

{{< video-card id="n8MnRmZzrxM" title="3 Stories Of Loving-kindness" date="2024-01-13" >}}
3 Stories of Lovingkindness.  The first story is from Kaua'i, Hawai'i, when a person did not want me on \"his\" street.  Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed.  Another story was also from the island, in 2015 when children on bicycles were yelling at us to go away.  Through the power of loving-kindness, things changed.  The last story is from 2011 during a trip to India.  The loving-kindness did not change the other, but a different outcome was the result.  The lady probably did not say, \"If you have Jesus in your heart, then you do not need to collect food.\"  I might be confusing it with another story from 2006 when I was going for alms in New Britain, CT.  Perhaps I'll tell that story later.  It is mentioned in my book Going For Broke: Travelogs on becoming a Buddhist monk.

{{< video-card id="iSTu8j2urnY" title="Acapella Inertia" date="2019-06-15" >}}
This is a story about a two people who fell in love. While they spontaneously started to dance outside of a Grateful Dead Show,, they found themselves dancing even after the music had stopped, hence the title \"A'capella Inertia\".  The story goes further to relate how meditation might be related to that experience.
