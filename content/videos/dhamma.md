{{< video-card id="0h2TeVeIITI" title="What Is Killing:  First Precept" date="2026-02-04" >}}
Here we talk about the first precept of killing. Summary: In Buddhism, “Killing” is defined by the technical mechanics of the mind, not by social laws. The unwholesome Kamma is complete only if Five Factors are present:  Presence: A Living Being. Perception: Knowing it is alive. Intention: A mind bent on killing. Effort: Making the attack. Result: The being dies. If all five are met, the precept killing (pāṇātipāta) is broken. This rule applies equally to Self-Defense, Euthanasia, and Abortion—Kamma judges the intention to destroy life, not the justification for doing so.

{{< video-card id="K8b0lm4oW9M" title="Deliberate Lies, The Elephant's Trunk" date="2025-12-27" >}}
The Buddha said to Rāhula in the Ambaṭṭhika Rāhulovāda Sutta:  Evameva kho, Rāhula, yassa kassaci sampajānamusāvāde natthi lajjā, nāhaṁ tassa kiñci pāpaṁ akaraṇīyanti vadāmi.  For one who has no shame in deliberate lying, I say there is no evil that person cannot do.  The Elephant’s Trunk The Buddha explained that an elephant always protects its trunk. The trunk is the last thing it will risk. But in ancient times, when elephants were trained for war, they were made to charge fully, without holding back, even exposing the trunk. Once that happens, there is no limit to what the elephant can destroy.  There Is No Limit It is the same with people. When someone tells a deliberate lie without any shame, it is like removing that last protection. After that, there is no evil they cannot do.  Evameva kho, Rāhula, yassa kassaci sampajānamusāvāde natthi lajjā, nāhaṁ tassa kiñci pāpaṁ akaraṇīyanti vadāmi.  For one who has no shame in deliberate lying, I say there is no evil that person cannot do.  Liar First, Killer Second Quite often, we see someone who commits a terrible murder. When he appears in court, he lies through his teeth, denying everything: “I’m innocent! I’m innocent!” When the truth comes out and the evidence is clear, we are shocked that he could lie so easily. We think, “If he can kill, then a lie is easy.” However, it is the other way around. He is a liar first, a killer second. The shameless deliberate lie opens the door to everything else.  Evameva kho, Rāhula, yassa kassaci sampajānamusāvāde natthi lajjā, nāhaṁ tassa kiñci pāpaṁ akaraṇīyanti vadāmi.  For one who has no shame in deliberate lying, I say there is no evil that person cannot do.  So please, always protect your trunk. Always speak the truth. It is very important.  Because when you lie deliberately without shame, there is no limit to the evil you can do.

3:37min   Here we retell the Dog Duty Ascetic Sutta from the Majjhima Nikāya, where an ascetic imitates a dog seeking heavenly rebirth. The Buddha reveals that such conduct only leads to rebirth among dogs.  We conclude urging instead the cultivation of genuine virtue and the pursuit of Nibbāna.  Transcript: There was a famous sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya called The Dog Duty Ascetic. There was an ascetic named Bhūna who came to the Buddha and asked, “Bhante, what would be the fruit of my practice?”  This ascetic acted like a dog all the time—he walked like a dog, ate like a dog, and lived as a dog. That was his practice. He had been following it faithfully, believing it would bring him to the heavenly realms.  The Buddha replied, “Don’t ask me this question.” The reason, the Buddha said, is that he only speaks what is true, beneficial, and timely. The Buddha always speaks the truth, but only when it is beneficial and at the right time.  Sometimes the truth may not be sweet or pleasant—especially when speaking to someone whose practice may lead to unfortunate results. The Buddha told the ascetic, “If you do this practice perfectly, the best that can happen is that you will be reborn among dogs.”  Now, in America, the dog’s life is quite different from the dog’s life in Asia. Some people even wish to be dogs! I have a friend who once said he wanted to be reborn as a dog because he has two dogs living on a nine-acre botanical garden estate in Kaua‘i. He said, “If I could come back as one of my dogs, that would be great!”  But people don’t know what it’s like for dogs in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, or Laos. In many parts of the world, the dog’s life is harsh. Even in America, where there are animal shelters, many dogs are still killed every year.  The Buddha said that if one performs such a practice with the wrong view—believing that acting like a dog will bring heavenly rebirth—this wrong view and wrong action lead instead to the lower realms, even below the animal realms, into the hell realms.  So my recommendation is this: live a good life every day. Embody wholesome character. Be a “goodie goodie.” Be a little angel in your mind. Always do the right thing. Don’t put on a costume—embody goodness from within.  If you act like an angel, that is what you become. But be an angel who uses that goodness for the purpose of reaching Nibbāna. Always wish for the conditions to reach Nibbāna.  Be good. Be kind. Be someone others naturally describe as “such an angel.” Whether it comes naturally or takes effort—make that effort.

{{< video-card id="kx9Wf_v2HsU" title="How to Pronounce The Buddha" date="2025-03-24" >}}
This is a video about how to pronounce \"The Buddha\" according to the authentic international Pāḷi pronunciation.  It is different from the American way to pronounce.  The focus is on aspirated consonants, like \"dha\".     Most of you already know, but some of you do not.  I was inspired to make this video a long time ago when my sister I discussed this and I finally got around to making it.  You can share this video with your friends if you like it...And I do hope you enjoy this.  Disclaimer.. as an American, I'm sure mispronounce things often and I probably will still make mistakes!

Benefits of Alms (last 5 minutes of Giving alms again and again). In this talk, I explain the benefits of going for alms, often with the hardships one faces.

Further benefits, are appreciation of food, easy to support, meditation, gratitude, and making merit by being a prop for others to make merit as well as the opportunity to share with others from one's own bowl.

In this video, I speak about the determinations made during chanting to only follow the Triple Gem as a refuge and no other.  This is a determination not only for life, but for the end of Samsara.  In the end, I use the power of my own story as a Western Monk and how it is definitely likely that I have made such oaths before, using the power of logic.   Notes:  HOMAGE TO THE BUDDHA (Buddha-vandanā)  Iti'pi so Bhagavā Arahaṁ, Sammā-sambuddho, Vijjā-caraṇa-sampanno, Sugato, Loka-vidū, Anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi, Satthādeva-manussānam, Buddho, Bhagavā'ti.
