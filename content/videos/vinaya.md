Here we discuss the misconception that there is some mystical purification process that happens during the pātimokkha.  Although the monk is pure when he leaves the pātimokkha, it is merely because he confessed his offences beforehand and he attended the pātimokkha (something he is supposed to do).  There is nothing magical.  Theravāda is about kamma and doing the right things.
