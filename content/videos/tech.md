In this small video, I explain how to make better dhamma videos, especially in today's \"new normal\" where zoom Dhamma Talks are being uploaded to YouTube.  I wish you well.  I threw this together quickly, and there are improvements that can be done, but I hope it conveys the important points.

Here is an Ardour tutorial for doing a punch in and out.  It is not polished with low video resolution, but it does the job.  I hope you like it and get benefit from it!  Version 5.6 was used for this video.  Thanks to the ardour IRC, I was able to learn this just yesterday.

{{< video-card id="_QzB3j6dgNU" title="Automation Sends Tutorial" date="2017-01-13" >}}
This is an Ardour 5 tutorial to show how to do Automation and Sends in Ardour 5.  This is the technique to add plugin effects to only a small portion of a track rather than the whole thing. This is a supplement to the tutorial for Ardour 3 which excludes the drawing tool  which is new to Ardour 5. http://brunoruviaro.github.io/ardour3-floss-tutorial/page6/  Some mistakes are listed below.. Some of the work Ardour work can be seen on this channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCoUJXm0dAxEChyuYtDKuA  Work in Process that uses this technique can be seen here. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Uv4wlWLt9rOFliTmJOcElNOXM  Review from Ardour Team. on IRC channel -headwar-  hi bhikkhusubhuti, thats IMHO a good way to make it. watch out, in the video you say the send fader is how intense the effect applies. No ! Its a real fader, controlling the amount sent to the FX bus. The amount of effect is 100%, but the level of the send affects how much of the signal is routed from your track to your bus, hence how the fx on the bus applies -oofus- bhikkhusubhuti: General points. in your channel you should have your aux send moved to post fader not pre, and in the delay bus you should have the delay plugin before the fader. -Headwar- bhikkhusubhuti: to ass on oofus' comment, I'd not choose \"strict I/O\" for the track, to allow the stereo effect to render their results in stereo -oofus- or use a stereo bus as the aux send from the mono track will add a panner which follows the channel panner for position, then if you pan the channel left or right the delay should follow which is far more natural
