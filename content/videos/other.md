{{< video-card id="857JZPF45DU" title="Sri Lankan Flood Food Distribution" date="2025-12-09" >}}
This morning I helped distribute meal donations to local villagers who were displaced by the recent floods. The community prepared nearly 500 breakfast packets, using 250 loaves of bread—just enough for everyone. We kept delivering more and more packets, going from one village to the next, but eventually we ran out. There are still so many people who need food, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, or anything else. In times like this, we simply give.  As we visited different neighborhoods, people were busy drying their belongings—stuffed animals hanging outside, mattresses in the sun, clothing scattered everywhere. Many homes looked like they were having a yard sale, but in reality they were just trying to recover what could still be used. The last village was especially heartbreaking. It reminded me of the final scene in Schindler’s List—you help so many, yet you still think of those you couldn’t reach.  The Buddha spoke of five timely gifts: – a gift to a visitor, – a gift to those on a journey, – a gift to the sick, – a gift given during a time of famine, – and a gift from the first harvest to those who live ethically.  Today’s offering of food is one of these timely gifts.  May all who are affected by the floods find safety, support, and strength. May generosity and compassion continue to flow to those in need.  Sādhu, sādhu, sādhu.

I had to remove a sticky label from a flask.  I thought it would be good to give. a small video on how to remove adhesive residue simply by using oil.  You can use any type of oil.  I had coconut oil so I used that.

I thought I would talk about how monasteries do construction in order to give hope that the monks and the lay people will be able to rebuild.  It will be a hardship for sure, but there is a good chance for merit to accrue.

Here is another \"Walk and Talk\" video and update.  Here, I talk about my progress in learning the Pāḷi language and also the benefit of reading Pāḷi which can slow one down.  I also talk about the benefits of repeating the very same Dhamma over and over again.  There is a lot one can learn, but putting the very basics into full practice is the most difficult part.
