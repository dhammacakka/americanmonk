I had to remove a sticky label from a flask.  I thought it would be good to give. a small video on how to remove adhesive residue simply by using oil.  You can use any type of oil.  I had coconut oil so I used that.

{{< video-card id="Vo2RkabU_Fo" title="Walk and Talk - Myanmar Can Rebuild" date="2025-04-03" >}}
I thought I would talk about how monasteries do construction in order to give hope that the monks and the lay people will be able to rebuild.  It will be a hardship for sure, but there is a good chance for merit to accrue.

Here is another \"Walk and Talk\" video and update.  Here, I talk about my progress in learning the Pāḷi language and also the benefit of reading Pāḷi which can slow one down.  I also talk about the benefits of repeating the very same Dhamma over and over again.  There is a lot one can learn, but putting the very basics into full practice is the most difficult part.

Here is the latest from EkaSara (One Voice).  It is called Khanda Paritta.  It is half of the sutta that is found on the link below.  EkaSara plans to redo the previous chants in a similar style similar to this one and the others have been pulled from archive, except for the Metta English Mix.  https://archive.org/details/khanda-full_session .  This sutta is required to be chanted daily if the monks live in the forest.  Its main purpose is to prevent snake bites, but it includes all types of animals, 0-leg (snakes), 2 legs, 4 legs, and many legs (insects and centipedes).  It is a magic spell.  Where is the magic?  Loving-Kindness.   I usually ask which of these are the most dangerous.  Most people say snakes.  It is my belief that the  two legged creatures are some of the most dangerous animals on earth.
